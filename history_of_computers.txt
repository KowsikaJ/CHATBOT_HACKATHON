xii A History of the Personal Computer 


Preface 

This book has been compiled to fill a gap in 
personal computer literature. There are many 
biographical books about key individuals such as Bill 
Gates of Microsoft or John Sculley of Apple. Other books 
are also available providing details of certain 
companies and their products . These books quite 
naturally focus primarily on products associated with 
that particular individual or company. 

The intent of this book is to provide a 
consolidated coverage of the significant developments in 
the evolution of the personal computer and related 
products. The book has some emphasis on the technical 
and commercial aspects of the developments as compared 
to the social details of the participants . 

Part I of the book provides a historical 
background on the beginning of digital computer 
technology. It is a cursory overview of early 
developments in both hardware and software from the late 
1930 's to the late 1950 's. It also describes the start 
of personal computing in the 1960's. Starting with time- 
sharing, then simpler programming languages, the first 
personal computer and finally significant improvements 
to the user interface. 

Part II is devoted to the beginning of the 
microcomputer: This is "The Altair/Apple Era". It covers 
the period of the 1970 's when the original 
microprocessors gave birth to microcomputers such as the 
Altair in 1975 and to the Apple II in 1977. This is the 
exciting period during which the Byte magazine started, 
the Homebrew Computer Club was founded, VisiCalc was 
created and many other entrepreneurs helped to create 
the microcomputer industry. 

Part III is "The IBM/Macintosh Era" and describes 
the corporate commercialism of the industry. It is the 
period of the 1980 's which began with the introduction 
of the IBM personal computer in 1981, followed by the 
release of the Apple Macintosh computer in 1984. This 
was another exciting period as the industry evolved from 
small entrepreneurial companies into participation by 
large corporations. The basis of the personal computer 
market had changed from the "hacker" of hardware and 
software, to the utilization by business and the non- 
technical home user. 

Part IV is a brief overview of the hardware, 
software and corporate activities in the 1990 's. 

Part V of the book is called "Bit's and Bytes" 
and provides details of the peripherals, magazines, 
people, companies and other organizations associated 
with the personal computer. One chapter also discusses 


Preface xiii 

such items as reference sources, standards and 
terminology origins . 

An extensive bibliography and two appendixes have 
been provided. The bibliography has a section on books 
and another section on periodical articles that describe 
initial product releases and other items of 
significance. These two sources provide extensive 
reference material for those interested in further study 
of personal computer history. 

There are limitations on the amount and diversity 
of historical information that can be included in a book 
of this size. The amount of detail on a particular 
subject has therefore been limited to items of 
historical and commercial significance. As regards 
hardware, this has intentionally resulted in more detail 
on the significant early developments from Apple and 
IBM. In software there is greater coverage of details on 
the Microsoft Corporation and its significant products. 
Also the focus has been on North America, where most of 
the development in microprocessor and microcomputer 
technology has occurred. The references cited in the 
bibliography will extend each subject area as reguired. 

A few comments on gualif ication of dates and 
dollar figures for prices are appropriate. Dates are 
sometimes termed announced, introduced, launched, 
released and shipped. The dollar figures will vary 
depending on the manufacturer's list price, the price in 
advertising, the street price and the date of 
publication. There also tends to be some inconsistency 
in both dates and prices depending on the source. These 
variations in dates and prices tend to create some 
ambiguity. It is hoped that the reader will understand 
this and take the dates and prices in a relative sense 
within a historical context. 

I have been involved with computers for close to 
thirty years. However, my modest start was an assignment 
by General Motors to do the critical path planning on a 
vehicle prototype using an IBM 1130 computer. That 
humble beginning initiated my education and fascination 
with the technology. I do hope that you find this book 
as interesting and informative to read as it was to 
write .

Relay Technology 

The original computers used mainly relay 
technology. Examples of these are those built by Howard 
Aiken in the USR, Bletchley Park in England, Konrad Zuse 
in Germany and those at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 
the USA. 

relay computers starting with the Complex Number 
Calculator. George Stibitz and S. B. Williams designed 
the calculator using 450 telephone relays and 10 
crossbar switches. The machine became operational in 
January 1940 and Stibitz demonstrated it from a remote 
location, Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire in 
September 1940. Following this Bell Laboratories 
developed the Models III, IV, V and VI computers. Bell 
completed the Model V, also known as the Bell 
Laboratories General Purpose Relay Calculator in 1946. 
It contained over 9,000 relays. An addition or 
subtraction required 0.3 seconds, a multiplication 0.8

Konrad Zuse designed a completely mechanical 
computer, the 21 in 1938. Zuse then developed a hybrid 
relay/ mechanical unit named the 22. R successful 

the German Aeronautical Research Institute for a more 
advance 23 machine. 2u3e completed the 23 computer in 
December 1941 using 2,300 relays. After the Second World 
War Zuse formed his own company that produced relay, 

Bletchley Park in England built a number of 

second World War for cryptoanalysis security work. M. H. 
A. Newman and C. E. Wynn-Williams completed a hybrid 
relay-vacuum tube machine called the Heath-Robinson in 
April 1943. The British Secrets Act has restricted the 
availability of technical information for the computing 
machines developed at Bletchley Park. 

Howard H. Aiken and IBM developed the Automatic 
Sequence Control Calculator (AECC) . IBM built the 
computer at its Endicott laboratory during the period of 
1939-43. It became operational in January 1943 and IBM 
presented the computer to Harvard University in August 
1944. It had 2,200 counter wheels, 3,300 relays, was 51 
feet long by 8 feet high and had a weight of 
approximately 5 tons. Addition or subtraction took about 
0.3 seconds, multiplication 6 seconds and division could 
require 16 seconds. Harvard renamed it the Mark I and 
during the next decade Aiken developed the Mark II, III 


Mechanical relay technology had inherent spes 
limitations as applied to computation. This led to tl 
use of vacuum tube technology that provided significai 
speed improvements .

computer at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, 
University of Pennsylvania during the period of 1943-46. 
ENIAC was a huge machine, having over 18,000 vacuum 
tubes and 1, 500 relays that consumed 17 4 kilowatts of 
power. Rn addition or subtraction calculation took 200 
microseconds, a multiplication 2,800 microseconds and a 
division 24,000 microseconds. The clock rate was 60-125 
kHz. The U.S. Rrmy Ordnance Department funded the 
computer development for use in calculating ballistic 


Other early computers developed and built during 
the late 1940s and early 1950s using vacuum tube 
technology were EDVAC, BINRC, UNIVRC, Whirlwind and IAS. 
During the early development of the digital computer 
there was a close liaison between research institutions 
in the USA and the United Kingdom. This resulted in 
significant research and development of vacuum tube 
computers in England.

early 1954. 

Most early computer development had occurred in 
the USA and England at university research institutions.

These machines met the diverse needs of business, 
industry and some fields of science into the 1940s. 

The first entry of IBM into the field of 
computers was the collaborative effort of the company

construction of the Automatic Sequence Control 
Calculator (ASCC) in 1939 and completed it as described

in electronic technology. Utilization of this new 
technology resulted in the development of the 603/4 
Electronic Multiplier in September 1946. IBM initiated 
construction of the "Super Calculator," the SSEC 
(Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator) in 1945 and 
dedicated it in January 1948, It had 21,400 relays, 
12,500 vacuum tubes and operated until January 1952. 

With the start of the Korean war in June 1950, 
IBM initiated steps to assist in the war effort with the 
development of the Defense Calculator. This new computer

important project was the joint development of the SAGE 
(Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) computer with MIT 
between 1952 and 1956. The company announced their last 
vacuum tube computer system, the 705 Model III, in 
September 1957. In October 1957 the company issued a 
memo stating a policy to use solid-state technology on 
all new computer developments. 

IBM demonstrated a transistorized version of the 
Type 604 calculator in October 1954 and the first 
transistorized product was the 608 calculator that 
shipped in December 1957. These two machines did not 
have a stored program. Consequently IBM called them 
calculators, not computers. IBM initiated a project in 
late 1955 for a supercomputer utilizing transistors and 
the latest technology that became known as the Stretch 
system. Then in October 1958 they announced the 7090 
Data Processing System using the Stretch technology. The 
first delivery of a 7090 system was in November 1959.

rt I The Historical Background 


Computer development at IBM and other 
institutions was very dependent on technology advances. 
Of particular importance were the advances in memory 
capabilities and solid state technology. 

l.S ... Technology 

Memory 

The following is relative to the computer 
internal memory and not auxiliary storage units such as 
magnetic drums, disks or tape drives. Memory was a 
crucial technology in the expanding use of the computer. 

The first electronic digital computer developed 
by Atanasoff during the period of 1538-42 used 

had two drums and each drum had 32 bands of 5 

capacity of 1,60 bits, or in more familiar terms 200 
bytes. 

The ENinc computer used vacuum tubes for memory 
storage. It used the decimal system and had 20 
accumulators for storage of variables. Each accumulator 
could hold a 10 place number. Each place number was a 10 
stage ring counter corresponding to the digits 1 to 5. 
Therefore it required 100 unique flip-flop vacuum tubes 
(plus 2 for sign) in each accumulator to store a 10 
place number. By taking certain liberties we could say 
the system had 100 unique bits in each of the 20 
accumulators, for a total of 2,000 bits or 250 bytes in 

tubes used for memory. A typical delay line used 

filled tube and could store 1, 000 bits. Eckert and 
Mauchly applied the concept on the EDVAC computer during 
the period of 1945-51. Other early computers such as 

EDSAC, BINAC for Northrop Aircraft, Inc., and the 
initial UNIVAG computers also used the acoustic delay 
line concept

utilizing the cathode cay tube for the IAS computer in 
1945. However F. C. Williams developed the first 
functional implementation of electrostatic memory on the 
University of Manchester test computer between 1946-48. 

the middle of 194 8 Williams was able to demonstrate a 
unit with a capacity of several thousand bits. 
Subsequently it was operational on the IRS computer and 
the IBM 701 System in 1952. 

Jay W. Forrestor evaluated magnetic core memory 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) 
between 1949 and 1951. Ferrite cores were operating at 
MIT and on the IBM 405 Recounting Machine in 1952. The 
first computer application of ferrite cores was on the 
Whirlwind computer at MIT in 1953. The preceding 
computer evolved into the SRGE (Semi Automatic Ground 
Environment) computers for a USA national air defense 
system. MIT selected IBM to build the computers. This 
defense program added significant impetus to the 
development of ferrite core technology. 

Each of these stages of memory development 

also enabled the use of larger and more complex 
software. Associated developments in secondary memory 
storage complemented the advances in internal memory. 

Seeonibuy Memory (Storage) 

The first electronic computers used paper cards 
for storage. Rtanasoff's computer used 8 . 5-by-l 1-inch 
cards and ENIAC used IBM cards. 

R. D. Booth of the United Kingdom was an early 
developer of various forms of memory storage. Booth 
experimented with thermal, rotating disk-pin and 
magnetic drum memories after the Second World War . By 
May of 1948 he had installed and demonstrated a working 
magnetic drum memory in the Automatic Relay Computer 
(ARC) . In the USA a company called Engineering Research 
Associates Inc . , (ERA) presented papers describing 


1/10 Parti The Historical Background 

conceived by Jacob Rabinow at the National Bureau of 
Standards (tJBS) in 1952. In early 1952, IBM established 
an advanced research development laboratory in San Jose, 
California that began looking at magnetic disk storage 
as an inexpensive fast data retrieval system. The 
requirements evolved from advance development of card- 
related applications and a United States Air Force 

requesting a change from batch to random access in the 
method of updating file systems. Extensive research was 
conducted on disk materials and coatings, various types 
of movable heads and electronic control systems for data 
storage. 

IBM demonstrated the first magnetic disk drive 
assembly with movable read-write-heads in May 1955 and 
described the concept at the Western Joint Computer 
Conference in February 1956. The assembly consisted of a 
stack of fifty coated aluminum disks, 2 4 inches in 
diameter, rotating at 1,200 revolutions per minute. Each 
disk surface contained 100 concentric recording tracks 
that provided a total storage capacity of 5 million 
characters (the equivalent of 50,000 IBM cards) . The 
system was subsequently announced as the IBM 350 Disk 
Storage system. The preceding and a scheme for automatic 
addressing of data, was incorporated into the IBM 305

Transistor and Integrated Circuit 

William B. Shockley was the director of a team of 
researchers that developed the transistor at Bell 
Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey, USA. The first 
transistor was operational in December 1947. John 

on a single semiconductor chip was first developed by 
Jack St. Clair Kilby at Texas Instruments, Inc., in 
1958. Kilby constructed the integrated circuit in 
germanium. Each component on the integrated circuit 
required precise and laborious interconnection by hand. 

Independently in 1959, Robert H. Noyce at 
Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation also developed a 
monolithic concept of integrating components on a single 
silicon chip. However, Noyce had also developed a 
practical method to interconnect the components. This 
new technology deposited an insulating layer on the 

by a photo resist technique. Then by depositing a 
vaporized metal layer, interconnection of the components 
was achieved in a practical manner. Noyce's concept had 
been facilitated by the invention of the planar process 
by Jean Hoerni, a technique to make a flat, or planar 
surface for transistors. The founding of Fairchild 
Semiconductor in 19 57, had been financed by Fairchild 
Camera and Instrument Corporation, who completed its 
ownership of the new company in 1959. 

interconnecting the components and the planar process 
were just as important as the integrated circuit 
concept . This would be crucial in the ensuing patent 
litigation between the two inventors and respective 
companies. In resolving the coverage of the patent 
applications between the two companies, an agreement 
resulted in Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce being declared

computer. However, it is software that facilitated the 
practical application of the computer. 

1.4 ... Software 

Development of the stored program concept had a 
direct relationship to advances in memory technology. 
The size, speed of access, reliability and cost of 
memory were crucial factors in the evolution of 
software. 

The BegmtUng 

The initial computers did not have a stored 
program, or what became known later as software. The 
first practical electronic computer ENIRC, used forty 
plug-boards, that required a configuration of wire 
connections for each instruction. Later changes utilized 
three panels, each containing 1,200 ten-position 

John von Neumann described the concept of storing 

first computer to function with a 
stored program was EDSRC at Cambridge University, 
England in 1949. 

Grace M. Hopper was an early pioneer in the 
development of initial programming languages. Her 
initial work started on the Mark 1 at Harvard University 
in 1544. Then at the Eckert-Mauchly Computer 
Corporation. The first compiler was R-0 and ran on the 
UNIVRC computer in 1952. This compiler formed the basis 
for other variations such as ARITH-MftTIC, MflTH-MATIC and 
FLOW-MftTIC (1955-58) which assisted in the later 
development of COBOL. 

One of the earliest applications of computer 
graphics was on the MIT Whirlwind computer, that was 
operational by 1953. This was an interactive system that 

applied to the SRGE defense system built by IBM. 


Development of the Computer 1/13 

FORTRAN 

In 1954 IBM established a project directed by 
John W. Backus to develop a compiler for the Model 704 

language FORTRftN (FORmula TRRNslation) that IBM finished 
in April 1957. The language had a notation oriented to 
mathematicians and scientists. Improvements in the 

language followed with the subsequent release of 
versions II, III and IV. 

COBOL 

By 1957 a number of people had become concerned 
that a common programming language designed for 

government also stated a concern about the proliferation 
of different compilers from the various computer 
manufacturers. In 1559 the Defense department initiated 

formed called CODRSYL (Committee On DAta SYstem 
Languages). The committee coordinated the development of 
a new language that became COBOL (common Business 
Oriented Language) . CODASYL formed other committees, to 
work on the definition and further development of the 
language. These developments resulted in the 1960 
release of COBOL. 

Games 

Artificial intelligence researchers started using 
computers and developed game software such as chess and 
checkers between the late 1940s and the 1950s. There 
were many researchers in this field of artificial 
intelligence. Early chess playing programs were 
developed by Claude E. Shannon in 1949 and Alex 
Bernstein in 1957. Arthur L. Samuel of IBM developed 

William Higinbotham and associate Dave Potter 
developed the first video game at Brookhaven National 
Laboratory in Upton, New York in 1958. Called Merlin, it 
simulated a game of tennis using an analog computer, 
oscilloscope display and paddle-type controllers for

u1:ilization of computers. As the number of users 
increased, new periodicals were published and new 
associations formed to disseminate information and 
facilitate user interaction. 

1.5... Otiter Developments 

Associations 

One of the first groups to be formed in the 
computer industry was the Rssociation for Computing 
Machinery (RCM) , founded during 1947/48. The Data 
Processing Management Association (DPMft) formed in 1945, 
is one of the largest groups with involvement in 
education and certification of data processing 
professionals. IBM customers were one of the first to 
form user groups. The 3HRRE group that formed in 1955 
had an initial orientation to scientific users. Rn IBM 
commercial users group called GUIDE (Guidance of Users 
of Integrated Data-processing Equipment) formed in 19 56. 
Then the International Federation for Information 
Processing (IFIP) formed in 1959. 

Magazines 

One of the earliest periodicals was the Digital 
Computer Newsletter started by the Office of Naval 
Research in 1949. Another early publication was the IBM 
Technical Newsletter series started in 1550. The ACM 
issued a quarterly Journal in 1954 that evolved into the 
Communications of the ACM in 1558. 

Datamation started in October 1957 as Research and 
Engineering (The Magazine of Datamation) . It started as 

publication in 1967.

Vannevar Bush published a futuristic article 
entitled "As Me May Think" in the July 1945 issue of 
Atlantic Monthly [12, pp. 47-55] . The article described

MIT 

MIT built the Memory Test Computer (MTC) between 
19 52 and 19 5 3 to test magnetic core memory planes for 
the Whirlwind 1 computer. Harlan Anderson and Kenneth 
Olsen designed MTC and would later co-found Digital 
Equipment Corporation (DEC) . The computer was a 16-bit 
unit built from standard Whirlwind plug-in circuit 
package forms. 

Following the completion of the MTC computer 
Olsen and Wesley A. Clark proposed the construction of a 
large transistorized computer, the TX-1 . Rejected by 
management, Clark designed a smaller 18-bit unit, the 
TX-0 in 1957. Then MIT developed the ARC (Average 
Response Computer) and a much larger computer, the TX-2 
in 1958 . One of the students using these computers was 
Charles E. Molnar. Molnar and Clark would later develop 
the first personal computer, the MIT LINC. 

IBM 

small Personal Automatic Calculator (PAC) project, 
starting in the late 1940s. He then described details of 
an engineering model of the PAC project in December 
1954. This project evolved into the IBM 610 Auto-Point 
Computer announced in September 1957. The system 
consisted of three units. A floor-standing cabinet that

punches, plugboard and magnetic drum. The other two 
units were an operator keyboard for control and data 
entry and an electric typewriter for printed output. It 
was one of the last two vacuum tube computer models 
built by IBM and the company considers this to be the 
first "Personal Computer." IBM built about 180 units at 
a purchase price of 555,000. 

DEC 

minicomputer market was Kenneth H. Olsen. After 
graduating from MIT he worked at the Lincoln 
Laboratories, then on the Whirlwind and SftGE computer 
systems between 1950 and 1957. Olsen co-founded Digital 
Equipment Corporation (DEC) with Harlan E. Anderson in 
August 1957, to provide low cost logic modules and 
computers for engineers and scientists. 

The first DEC minicomputer was the 18-bit PDP-1 
(Programmed Data Processor - One). DSC demonstrated the 
PDP-1 prototype at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference 
in December 1959. It had a cathode-ray tube display, 
keyboard and was the first small commercial interactive 
general-purpose computer . 

Conclusion 

The general use of large commercial and 
scientific computers was firmly established by the end 
of the 1950s. However the major computer manufacturers 
did not commit sufficient resources to the development 
of small competitive computer systems. This resulted in 
other companies releasing small computers such as the 
Bendix Aviation Corporation G-15, the Librascope/General 
Precision LGP-30 in 1956 and the DEC PDP-1 announcement 
in 1959. 

These small systems were lowering the cost of 
computer technology. Although they targeted at 
scientific users, they were a part of the evolution to 
personal computing and the first personal computer in 
the 1960s.

Chapter 3 Microprocessors in the 1970's 

The creation of the tcansistoc in 1947 and the 
development of the integrated circuit in 1958/59, is the 
technology that formed the basis for the microprocessor. 
Initially the technology only enabled a restricted 
number of components on a single chip. However this 
changed significantly in the following years. The 
technology evolved from Small Scale Integration (SSI) in 
the early 1960's to Medium Scale Integration (MSI) with 
a few hundred components in the mid 1960's. By the late 
1960's LSI (Large Scale Integration) chips with 
thousands of components had occurred. 

This rapid increase in the number of components 
in an integrated circuit led to what became known as 
Moore's Law. The concept of this law was described by 
Gordon Moore in an article entitled "Cramming More 
Components Onto Integrated Circuits" in the April 1965 
issue of Electronics magazine [338| . Moore' s Law 
initially stated that the number of transistors on a 
semiconductor chip would keep doubling every year. This 
was later changed to every 18 to 24 months. The "law" 
has held up remarkably well since 19 65 and has had a 
profound effect on computer technology. 

Advanced chip technology enabled Texas 
Instruments to develop the first electronic calculator 
in 1967. Then they worked with the Canon company to 
produce the worlds first pocket calculator, the 
Pocketronic in April 1971. During this period another 
company called Intel had entered the semiconductor

Gordon E . Moore and Robert N . Noyce resigned from 
Fairchild Semiconductor and founded a company called N M

the integrated circuit at Fairchild, Moore the director 
of the research and development laboratory. Rrthur Rock 
and other investors provided venture capital for the 
company startup. Shortly after, they changed the company 
name to Intel Corporation, signifying Integrated 
electronics. Andrew S. Grove who was assistant director 
of research and development at Fairchild joined Intel 
shortly after the founding as director of operations. 
The company became a public corporation in October 1971. 

The initial focus of the company was to develop 
large scale integrated (LSI) memory chips to replace 
magnetic core memory. Intel introduced the 1101, a 256 
bit MOS static random access memory in September 1969. 
Then Intel started producing the 1103 chip, the worlds 
first IK bit dynamic random access memory (DRRM) in 
October 1970. This provided significant reductions in 
the cost of computer memory. However a request for logic 
chips would change the focus of the company to include 


The First Microprocessor (4-Bi0 

In April 1969, a Japanese calculator company 
called Busicom asked Intel to develop a set of at least 
twelve custom logic chips for a new low cost desk top 
calculator. Marcian E. "Ted" Hoff evaluated this request 
and determined that the design configuration proposed by 
the customer was too complex. Hoff had experience with 
the DEC PDP-8 architecture and proposed that Intel 
develop a four-chip set incorporating a general-purpose 

calculator BCD (Binary Coded Decimal] requirements and 
possibly other applications. Intel's executive staff 
approved the proposal and design proceeded with 

the Intel proposal for a general processor and 
associated chips in October 1969. 

Busicom paid Intel 560,000 to produce the chip 
family configuration for use in their calculators in 
early 1970. Federico Faggin who joined Intel in April 
1970, did the detailed circuit design and layout of the 
chips. The final configuration consisted of four 16 pin 


Microprocessors in the 1970's 3/7 

(CPU) , a 256 by 8-bit read only memory (ROM) , a 320-bit 
random access memory (RAM) and a shift register for 
input/output (l/O) . The CPU chip measured one-eighth of 
an inch wide by one-sixth of an inch long and had about 
2, 300 transistors. The CPU included a 4-bit parallel 

push-down stack on one chip. This CPU chip became known 
as the 4004 4-bit microprocessor. It had a set of forty 
five instructions, operated at 108 kilohertz and could 
execute 60,000 operations a second. Faggin produced 
working samples in nine months and Intel delivered sets 
of chips to Busicom in March 1571. 

In early 1971, Busicom got into financial 
difficulties and Intel obtained the design rights for 
applications other than calculators in return for a 
lower price on the chips. In mid-November 1971, the 
first advertisement for a commercially available 
microprocessor, the Intel 4004 appeared in Electronic 
News. Intel advertised it as the MCS-4 {Micro Computer 
System 4-bit) family of four integrated chips. The 
advertisement stated it was "Announcing a new era of 
integrated electronics... A micro-programmable computer 
on a chip!" The 4004 CPU chip sold for S200. It was 
indeed the beginning of a new era, but the 8-bit 
microprocessor is what started the microcomputer 
industry. 

S-Bit Mtcropro cessors 

In late 19 69, concurrent with the Busicom 
development. Computer Terminal Corporation (GTC) , which 
later became Datapoint , contracted with Intel and Texas 

intelligent terminal. Ted Hoff and Stan Mazor analyzed 

integrated chip could contain all the logic. Intel 
initially assigned the chip design to Hal Feeney. Then 
at the end of 1970 Federico Faggin directed the 
development of the chip that became the Intel 1201. 
During the summer of 1971 Datapoint agreed to let Intel 
use this architecture in exchange for a release from the 
development charges . Experience with the Intel 4004

1201 chip to 8008 . 

Intel introduced the first 8-bit 8008 

microprocessor in April 1972 as a family of products, 
the MCS-8 (Micro Computer System 8-Bit) . The 16 pin 8008 
had 3,500 transistors and operated at about 0.2 MHz. The 
microprocessor had a set of 66 instructions, with 4 5 

six 8-bit general registers and could address 16K bytes 
of memory. The chip implemented interrupts, however the 
interrupts worked poorly. This chip with its 8-bit 

processing as compared to the 4004 4-bit microprocessor. 
It was the first true general purpose microprocessor. 

microcomputer industry. The e 

as the French Micral in 1973 

8 in 1974 used the Intel 8008 microprocessor. 

The 4004 and the 8008 chips had started the 
technology, but a new chip, the 8080 had a more 
significant impact on the microcomputer market. Federico 
Faggin proposed the new faster chip and its use of high- 
performance NM03 (H-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor) 
technology as compared to PMOS (P-channel Metal Oxide 
Semiconductor) used on the 4004 and 8008 

microprocessors. Masatoshi Shima who had moved from 
Busicom headed the design team. Intel approved 
development in the summer of 1972 and introduced the 8- 
bit 8080 chip in April 1974. 

This new 40 pin chip with 5, 000 transistors, 
operated at 2-3 MHz, could execute 290,000 operations a 
second, had 111 instructions and could address 64K bytes 
of memory. The chip offered a tenfold increase in 
throughput compared to the 8008. It also required only 6 
support chips for operation as compared to 20 for the 
8008. Intel had an initial price of 5360 for the chip in 

MITS used this chip on the Rltair 8800 in 1975. 
The microprocessor had a significant impact on the early 
development of microcomputers. However Motorola and 


Microprocessors in the 1970's 3/9 

The Motorola MC6800 had a single +5-volt powe i: supply 
requirement and the Zilog Z-80 was faster with more 
features. 

The competitive pressure from Motorola and Zilog 
resulted in the release of a faster 8-bit 

microprocessor, the 8085 in November 1576. It had more 
functions integrated, a 113 instruction set and only 
required a single 5-volt power supply. 

The 8085 was faster but National Semiconductor 

in 1974. Intel had started a 16-bit microprocessor 
project but was having problems that resulted in a 
conservative development schedule. 

1 6-Bit Microprocessors 

Management had approved development of a unique 
16-bit architecture in late 1974 . Then in mid 1975, 
William W. Lattin who had been the manager of memory and 
microprocessor products at Motorola, moved to Intel and 

multiprocessing architecture that became the 32-bit iRPX 
432 (Intel Advanced Processor architecture) product. 
However due to product development delays and 
competitive pressures, Intel released the 8-bit 8085 in 
1976 and began a second 16-bit project that became the 
8086. 

Development of the 8086 microprocessor with a 16- 
bit architecture started in 1976. Jean Claude Cornet was 
assigned to manage the project and William B . Pohlman 
who had managed the 8085 design was also the leader for 
the 8086 design team. Stephen P. Morse defined the 
microprocessor architecture and created it as an 
extension of the 8080 architecture to provide software 
compatibility, Intel introduced the 8086 with ten times 
the performance of the 8080 in June 1978. 

The chip has 29,000 transistors with a minimum 
feature size of 3 microns and at a clock speed of 5 MHz 
it has a rating of 0.33 MIPS (million instructions per 
second) . The instruction set is an expanded version of 
the 8080 with 133 instructions. Memory addressability is

frequencies of 5, 8 and 10 MHz. The price at launch was 
$360. 

Intel introduced the 8088 microprocessor in June 
1979. It has a 16-bit internal architecture with an 8- 
bit external data bus. This 8-bit external data bus 
allowed for a simpler interfacing to the rest of the 

characteristics is similar to the 8086. The memory 
addressability is 1 megabyte and the microprocessor is 
available at clock frequencies of 5 and 8 MHz. 

IBM selected this microprocessor for the PC 
computer announced in Rugust 1981. This computer became 
a dominant product in the personal computer marketplace 
of the early 1980' s, and was crucial in helping to

Microprocessor Development at Intel" [342] and s^n Intel 
publication entitled "R Revolution in Progress: A

details on Intel microprocessors and a history of the 
company. Intel had pioneered the introduction of 
microprocessors. However other companies had entered the 
marketplace with competing products. One of the other 
dominant companies was Motorola.

Paul V. Galvin founded the Galvin Manufacturing 
Corporation in Chicago, in 1928. Then the company name 
changed to Motorola, Inc., in 1947. Following the name 
change and the invention of the transistor in 1947, the 
company opened a research laboratory in 1950, in 
Phoenix, Arizona to explore solid-state electronics. 
Motorola is now a major supplier of discreet 

Motorola introduced the 8-bit MC6800 MPU (Micro

terminal in late 19 69 . This requirement resulted in TI 

developing and submitting a single-chip microprocessor 
to CTC. 

TI has stated in company literature that it 

company applied for a patent in 1971 with the invention 
being credited to Gary W. Boone an Michael Cochran (the 
patent was approved in February 1978). The company 
described their invention as a "microcomputer --the 

complete computer on a single chip of silicon" [178]. TI 
advertised the integrated circuit developed for the 

caption "GPU on a chip" in June 1971. This was the first 

functional problems with the chip and never marketed it. 
However, it did lead to the subsequent development of 
the TMSIOOO microprocessor. 

TI released the TMSIOOO 4-bit microprocessor in 
1974. The chip had a set of 43 instructions and included

MOS Technology 

In July 1975, MOS Technology, Inc., started 

compatible with the Motorola MC6800 and would cost only 
$20. Chuck Peddle who had left Motorola and joined MOS 
Technology was a principal in the design of the 
microprocessor. Motorola subsequently forced the company 
to withdraw the 6501 because of technology 

However MOS was also developing another chip, the 
8-bit 6502 with additional features that would only cost 
$25. The chip had approximately 9,000 transistors. This 
pricing had a significant effect on the lowering of 
prices for microprocessors at both Intel and Motorola. 
This reduction in the cost of microprocessors resulted

The MOS 6502 miccoprocessoi: had a significant 
impact on the early miccocomputer market. The Apple II, 
Atari 400 and 800 and Commodote PET microcomputets used 
the chip. Commode te International purchased MOS 
Technology in October 1976. 

Zilog Inc. 

In the summei: of 1974, Federico Faggin and Ralph 
Ungermann decided to leave Intel and founded Zilog Inc., 
in November. Zilog is an acronym for the "last word (Z j 
in integrated (i) logic (log)." Shortly after the 
founding, the powerful oil corporation Exxon, invested 
$1.5 million in Zilog for a 51 percent controlling 
interest in the company. Faggin and Ungermann developed 
ideas for a new microprocessor and family of components 
that would be compatible and more powerful than the 
Intel 8080. Assisting in the design effort was Masatoshi 
Shima who had also left Intel and joined Zilog. It would 

instructions than the 8080. 

Zilog announced the S-80 microprocessor in 1975 
and it became available in February 1976. It operated at 
2.5 MHz, could address 64K bytes of memory and 
incorporated the 8 080 's instruction set within 158 
instructions. The chip had 8,500 transistors and was 
manufactured by the Mostek company. The Z-80 with a low 
price of $200, became a successful alternative to the 
Intel 8080. Zilog announced a faster 4 MHz version of 
the chip, the Z-80A in February 1977. A number of early 
microcomputers such as the Radio Shack TRS-80 used the 

The Z-8000 was a 16-bit microprocessor with 
17, 5 00 transistors and 110 instructions. The memory 
address capability was 48 megabytes in six segments of 
eight megabytes and the operating speed was 2.5 to 3.9 
MHz. Zilog priced the microprocessor at $195 for small 
quantities and announced it in early 1979. The 
instruction set was not compatible with the Z-80 and 
other design problems prevented it from becoming 


lithe 1970's 3/15 


Other Sources 

n number of other companies became second sources 
for the major suppliers. The following are some of the 
more significant suppliers. 

Walter Jeremiah (Jerry) Sanders was a principal 
in the founding of Advanced Micro Devices (RMD) , Inc., 
with seven other Fairchild personnel in mid 19 65. 
Sanders had worked for Motorola then Fairchild 
Semiconductor where he became sales and marketing 

source for other manufacturers chips by creating an 
equivalent design or by obtaining a license agreement 
from the other company. Early license agreements were 
with Intel for the 8085 microprocessor and with Zilog 
for the Z-8000. RMD became a public company in September 
1972 and the Siemans AG company made an investment of 
$30 million for nearly 20 percent of AMD in late 1977. 

Hewlett-Packard developed a proprietary 

was used in the company's HP-85 personal computer 
released in 1980. 

Mostek was founded by L. J. Sevin and 
subsequently became a subsidiary of United Technologies. 
It was a major supplier of semiconductor memory chips 
and a second source for other company's microprocessors 
such as the Zilog Z-80. 

National Semiconductor Corporation was founded in 
1959. Charles E. Sporck who had been at Fairchild 
Semiconductor joined the company in 1968, became the 
president and a significant contributor to the success 
of the company. The company offered microprocessor 
systems on a 8.5 by 11-inch PC card. The IMP-8 was an 8- 
bit microprocessor system and the IMP-16 was a 16-bit 
microprocessor system available in 1973. Then National 
Semiconductor announced the first 16-bit single chip 
microprocessor, called the Pace in 1974. A faster 
microprocessor called the Super-Pace followed. The SC/MP 

RCA introduced the 1802, the first complementary 
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 8-bit microprocessor in 
1974, that was followed by the 1804 microprocessor. 


3/16 Part II 1970's -- The Altaii/Apple era 

Rockwell introduced the PPS-4 that was a 4-bit 
parallel processor in late 1972. It had a 50 instruction 
set. Rockwell subsequently released the PPS-8, 

Signet ics Corporation was founded by four 
Fairchild Semiconductor executives in 1961. The company 
name is an acronym for "Signal Network Electronics . " The 
company shipped an 8-bit Programmable Integrated 
Processor (PIP) in 1974 that had more than 64 
instructions. The Signetics 2650, is another processor 
available from the company around 1978. Signetics was 
also a second source for microprocessors to companies

Recording to Gilbert Hyatt he built his first 
breadboard concept of a small computer in 1968, 
trademarked the term "microcomputer" and started a 
company called Micro Computer Inc (MCI) . Hyatt made 
application for a broad patent with a title "Data 
Processing System" in 1569. The application was rejected 
by the U.S. Patent Office. This was appealed by Hyatt 
and in December 1970 the Patent Office accepted a new 
application with a title "Factored Data Processing 
System for Dedicated applications . " Hyatt continued 
working on printed circuit prototypes but did not 
demonstrate or prove that his concept was practical. In 
question was Hyatt's ability to implement the patent on 
a single chip at the time of the patent application. At 
that time the technological capabilities were just

single integrated chip. In September 1971, Hyatt's Micro 
Computer company went out of business. Hyatt continued 
to have problems with his patent application that 
resulted in further appeals and changes to the 

application. Then in July 1950, the U.S. Patent Office 
awarded Hyatt a patent that now had a title of "Single 
Chip Integrated Circuit Computer Architecture . " This 
immediately created significant controversy in the 
industry. However in June 1996, the patent was 
overturned. 

Between 1969 and March 1971, Intel conceived and 
developed the 4004 microprocessor as described in 


extended existing technology. This rather casual 
approach resulted in Intel not filing a patent 
application for the microprocessor. Ted Hoff has stated 
that he published an article in March 1970 describing 
the feasibility of building a central processor on a 
chip. This in essence placed the concept of a 

a viable patent application.

Section 3.3. However TI withdrew their microprocessor 
due to functional problems and the following products 
were not accepted by any major microcomputer 

The Texas Instrument patent that was approved by 
the U.S. Patent Office in 1978 has not been successfully 
contested. However Hyatt's patent that was approved by 
the U.S. Patent Office in July 1990 was overturned in 
1956. Neither of these patents has affected Intel which 
became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for 
personal computers .

Chapter 6 Microsoft in the 1970' s 
6.1... Gates/Allen Early Years 

William Henry Gates was born on the 28th. of 
October 1955 in Seattle, Washington. He was the only son 
and the second of three children by William and Mary 
Gates. The father was a prominent Seattle lawyer and the 

United Way. 

Bill's parents enrolled him in Seattle's exclusive 
Lakeside School in 1567. This was a progressive private 
all male school with a disciplined approach to 
education. During the 1967/63 school year, the teaching 
staff recommended acquisition of computer facilities to 
expose the students to the technology. The school could 
not afford to purchase a computer. However the Lakeside 
Mothers Club agreed to finance the use of a time sharing 
service. In 1968 the school obtained an ASR-33 Teletype 
terminal and used a local access line to dial into a 
General Electric Mark II time sharing system. In his 
19 68/69 school year at the age of thirteen. Bill Gates 
started programming. 

Another student interested in programming was Paul 
G. Allen, who was born in 1953. From their mutual 
enthusiasm for programming computers a friendship 
developed which continued through high-school and 
university. It is this association that eventually led 
to their founding of Microsoft.

The students' enthusiasm for programming quickly 
strained the schools' time sharing budget. Fortunately 
the parent of another student had become one of the 
founders of Computer Center Corporation (CCC) . This 
corporation had installed a Digital Equipment 

Corporation PDP-10 computer to offer time sharing 
service in the Seattle area. The corporation had a 
shakedown agreement, whereby DEC did not require payment 
for the computer until the equipment and software 
operated to the customers' satisfaction. The company 
suggested to the school that the students help test the 
computer system for bugs. In return they would receive 
free computer time. This became an intensive period of 
programming and acquisition of computer technology 
knowledge for both Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Not only 
did they de-bug the DEC PDP-10 system, but they invaded 
the intricacies of the computer accounting files to 
access the passwords. This resulted in a temporary

disciplinary period of exclusion from the system. 
However after a short period of assisting the company 
programmers, Computer Center Corporation encountered 
financial difficulties and went into receivership in 
March 1970. 

the University of Washington where Paul Rllen's father 
was the associate director of the libraries. The 
university had a Xerox Data Systems (XDS) Sigma V time 
sharing computer and a Control Data Corporation (CDC) 
Cyber 6400 computer. Gates and Rllen used both computers 
for a period of time . 

Lakeside now managed to obtain on loan a DEC PDP- 
3/L computer. Gates obtained the source code for a 
version of BASIC from DECUS, a DEC user's group. He 
then started working on his own first version of a BASIC 
interpreter. However before he had completed the 
software. Lakeside returned the DEC PDP-8/L. Lakeside 
then received a Data General Nova computer. However the 
school returned the computer before Gates could adapt 
his BftSIC interpreter to the new machine architecture. 

Then in the fall of 1970, Lakeside arranged with 
Information Sciences, Inc., (ISI), a time sharing 
company in Portland, Oregon for use of their DEC PDP-10. 
By this time Gates, Allen and two other friends Richard 
Meiland and Kent Evans from Lakeside had formed an 
organization called the Lakeside Programmers Group. The 
group managed to obtain a contract from ISI to develop a 
payroll program in COBOL. Once again this contract 
provided computer time in exchange for the work required 
to develop the payroll software. It also provided 

a commercial program. 

During 1970/71 a Lakeside teacher and former 
Boeing engineer had the task assigned of creating a 
program for class scheduling. Unfortunately a flying 
accident killed the teacher. Gates and his friend Kent 

in FORTRAN. However another tragic accident killed Evans 
in a mountaineering class. Paul Allen had enrolled at 
the Washington State University in the fall of 1971. He

university computer that would er

microprocessor. 


Gates started sending applii 

-ations for enrollment 

to different universities at the e 

nd of 1972. Then Gates 

and Rllen got offers from TRW to w 

ork on the development 

of PDP-10 system software. TRW w.

time operating and dispatch syst< 

?m for the Bonneville 

Power Administration in Vancouver 

, Washington. TRW was 

in desperate need of experienced DEC PDP-10 programmers. 

They both accepted jobs, nllen left university and Gates 

got permission to finish his fina 

1 high-school year in 

an internship with TRW. Access to 

the DEC PDP-10 allowed 

Allen to complete his Intel 8008 s 

imulator program. This 


also allowed Gates to complete the programming for the 
Traf-0-Data project. 

In the fall of 1973 Allen returned to University 
and Gates entered Harvard University. During his first 
year. Gates met and became a friend of Steven (Steve) A. 
Ballmer, who would later become the president of 
Microsoft. Hot completely happy with university life, 
both Allen and Gates considered taking a year off and 
applied for jobs at different companies. They were both 
offered jobs at Honeywell in Massachusetts. Allen 
accepted a position and moved to Boston. Gates declined 
the job offer. Paul Allen and Bill Gates would now meet 
on weekends and some weekday evenings to discuss 
computers, Traf-O-Data and other possible projects.

machine, Allen's simulation program and a modified DEC 
BASIC interpreter that Gates had written were going to 
be significant factors. Gates and Allen decided to 
develop a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800 
computer. The interpreter with some modification would 
also be capable of running on other microcomputers using 
the Intel 8080 microprocessor. The Altair 8800 computer 


6/6 Paitn 1970's-TheAltair/Apple era 

Gates contacted HITS and advised Roberts that they 
had a BASIC interpreter. The timing was right. Roberts 
was just as anxious to have a BASIC interpreter as Gates 
and Allen were to develop and sell one. In the initial 
contacts between Roberts and Gates/Allen there were two 
problems. The first problem was that Gates and Allen had 
not developed the BASIC interpreter for the Intel 8080 

memory boards at that time capable of storing the BASIC 
interpreter software. Gates agreed to Roberts suggestion 
of going to MITS Inc., in a month to demonstrate the 

The next four weeks were intensive. Allen started 
converting the Intel 8 00 8 simulator software to emulate 
the Intel 8080 microprocessor. He also adapted assembler 
and debugger programs for the Intel 8080. Gates started 
working on the specifications for the BASIC interpreter. 
To a certain extent some programming languages develop 
based on earlier experience with similar languages. 
Gate's BASIC interpreter evolved from DEC'S BASIC-Plus. 
The 4K memory limitation limited the number of features. 
This memory limitation had to accommodate not just the 
interpreter but also the user program data. 

When the interpreter specification was complete, 

program. Gates and Allen used the DEC PDP-10 computer at 
Harvard to create all the programs. Program development 
consumed any time left after Gates Harvard classes and 
Allen's job at Honeywell, Gates and Allen also obtained, 
the assistance of Harvard student Monte Davidoff, to 
develop the mathematical routines for the interpreter. 
The interpreter had now grown to require 6K instead of 
the 4K of memory initially targeted. 

Paul Allen demonstrated the BASIC interpreter at 
MITS Inc., in Albuquerque, New Mexico in late February. 

8800 microcomputer or the Intel 8080 microprocessor. 
However it was a success. Allen's simulator and Gates 

an incredible achievement. 

Roberts wanted to market the BASIC program as 


Microsoft iu the 1970's 6/7 


Paul Rllen left Honeywell and joined MITS Inc., to 
develop software foe the ftltair 8800 in March. Shortly 
after joining MITS, Allen became the Director of 
Software. In Rpril, the headline "Altair BASIC Up and 
Running" was on the first issue of the Altair users 

MITS began a promotion campaign featuring a mobile 

1575 . It traveled all over the country and included a 
demonstration of a preliminary Version 1.1 of Gates and 
Allen's BASIC interpreter program. During its stop in 
California a member of the Homebrew Computer Club 
appropriated a copy of the paper tape with the BASIC 
interpreter encoded on it. The club members reproduced 
the tape and distributed copies to other members. 

Gates and Allen signed a contract with MITS in 
July, just prior to the founding of Micro-Soft. The 
wording of this contract would be crucial in later 
developments. It required Gates and Allen to provide 
BASIC interpreter programs on an exclusive license basis 
to MITS Inc. MITS agreed to promote and commercialize 
the program to other companies on a "best efforts" 
basis. This allowed MITS to sell copies of the BASIC 
interpreter and pay Gates and Allen a royalty on each 
sale. Gates and Allen still retained ownership of the 
software. The agreement specified three versions of the 
software with varying memory requirements of 4K, 8K and 
12K bytes. The compensation to Gates and Allen varied 
depending on the version. Another arrangement prevailed 
if the software was sub-licensed to other companies. 
They also specified that a secrecy agreement be signed 
by all MITS customers who purchased the software. Gates 

Version 2.0 of both the 4K and 8K BASIC 
interpreter programs had started shipping in July 1975. 
The software received strong favorable responses in the 
market. Gates secured the services of Monte Davidoff 
from Harvard and Chris Larson from Lakeside School to 


6/8 Pait n 1970's - The Altair/Apple era 

6.3 ... The Albuquerque Years 

In Rugust 1975 Bill Gates and Paul Rllen founded a 
partnership called Micro-Soft in Rlbuquerque, New 
Mexico. The company name was an abbreviation of 
Microcomputer-Software. The company deleted the hyphen 
in 1976 and capitalized the "S" to form Microsoft for a 
period of time . The partnership agreement gave Gates a 
sixty percent interest and Rllen the remaining forty 
percent. Gates felt he had made a larger contribution. 

Gates now started working on refinements for 
version 3 and an Extended BRSIC requiring 12K bytes of 
memory. However Gates had also received requests to 
develop a disk version of their program. Gates was 
having to spend additional time to satisfy these demands 
and a desire to expand the company. 

In the September 1975 issue of the Rltair Computer 
Notes newsletter, the editor David Bunnell wrote an 
article condemning the piracy of the BRSIC interpreter. 
The October issue included an additional article on 
piracy by Ed Roberts of MIT3 . Then the February 1976 
issue of the newsletter included an open letter by Gates 
to the hobbyists complaining of the piracy. The subject 
also received discussion at the first World Alt air 
Computer Convention in March. Then Bill Gates prepared a 
final letter and appeal that appeared in the April issue 

by all producers of software for the personal computer 

In September 1975, Gates enlisted the help of 
Richard Weiland from the Lakeside Programmers Group. 
Weiland developed a BASIC interpreter for the new Altair 
630B computer that used a Motorola M6800 microprocessor. 
Allen rewrote the 8080 simulator for the Motorola 

by January 1976. 

Allen and Gates licensed the 6800 BASIC 

interpreter to MITS for a flat fee. This assured 

Microsoft of a definite revenue and MITS could charge

Copying concerns with the 6800 BASIC interpreter had 

In early 1976, MITS was shipping approximately 
1,000 computers a month. However Microsoft was only 
getting a royalty for its software, at a rate of less 
than 200 copies per month. Illegal copies were affecting 
Microsoft revenue . 

In February 1976, while still at Harvard, Gates 
started writing the software for a version of BASIC 
suitable for a system utilizing disk drive technology. 
Gates had the software created and operating within a 
period of two to three weeks. It became known as DISK 
BASIC. 

In April 1976, the company hired its first 
permanent employee, Marc McDonald. He began work on what 
became known as Stand-alone Disk BASIC for the National 
Cash Register (NCR) company. Richard Weiland became the 
second employee in May with the position of general 
manager. In mid summer Gates started developing APL (A 
Programming Language) software. Then Microsoft hired 

development of FORTRAN software. Work also started on 
the Focal language. DEC initially developed Focal to 
control scientific instruments. However sales of 
Microsoft Focal were a failure, that resulted in it 
being discontinued. Microsoft now started to obtain 
corporate customers for its BASIC interpreters. Then it 
opened its first office in Albuquerque in 1976. 

Microsoft also started working on a 6502 BASIC 
interpreter for the MOS Technology microprocessor. Marc 
McDonald adapted the 6800 simulator to the 6502 and 
Richard Weiland developed the 6502 BASIC interpreter. 
The interpreter included a built-in editor for making 
program changes. The Apple II and other computers used 
the 6502 microprocessor. In October 1976 Commodore 

bought MOS Technology and selected the Microsoft 6502 
BASIC interpreter for its new PET computer. Commodore 
placed the BASIC program in ROM that resulted in every 
Pet computer having Microsoft BASIC. 

Microsoft, also offered its simulator, debugger 
and assembly development software called Develop-80, 
Develop- 68 and Develop- 65 for sale without success.

General Electric purchased the Microsoft 8080 BASIC 
interpreter in late 1976. Then in Hovember 1976 Paul 
nllen left MIT3 and joined Microsoft full time. Revenue 
for the company's first year was over 5100,000. 

In December 19 76, Pertec Computer Corporation 
signed a letter of intent to purchase MITS Inc. 
Microsoft had a number of potential customers for sub 
licensing through MITS during early 1977. However MITS 
was not promoting the business or using its "best 

Microsoft. Microsoft advised MITS in April that it was 
terminating its license agreement with them. In May MITS 
filed a restraining order that prohibited Microsoft from 
marketing 8080 BASIC and requested settlement of the 
contract by arbitration. Then MITS finalized the sale of 
their company to Pertec in late May. In late 1977 the 
arbitrator decided in favor of Microsoft. Although 
Pertec could still sell the BASIC interpreters, they no 
longer had an exclusive license. Microsoft could now 

retain the full sales revenue. 

Gates left Harvard in January 1977 and was now 
full time at Microsoft. Then in February, Gates and 
Allen formalized their partnership agreement. Gates 
would have a sixty-four percent share and Allen thirty- 
six percent. 

Microsoft had decided to expand its software 
market from BASIC interpreters to other programming 
languages such as COBOL, FORTRAN and Pascal. The company 
also decided to write the software for use with the 
Digital Research CP/M operating system. The first 
language to be released was a FORTRAN-80 compiler with a 
price of S500 in July 1977. 

Apple Computer purchased a license for the 6502 
BASIC interpreter in August . Previously Apple had used 
Integer BASIC written by Stephen Wozniak. Apple released 
the interpreter with modifications by Randy Wigginton of 
Apple as Applesoft BASIC. Microsoft had also started 
development of a new version of BASIC for Texas 
Instruments (TI) that had to be in compliance with a new 
ANSI BASIC standard. Paul Allen once again created a

simulatoi: for the TI TMS9900 microprocessoir and Gates 
hired Bob Greenberg to develop the BASIC software. 

Another important contract from NCR required 
development of a disk version of BASIC for their 8200 
terminal. The company assigned Marc McDonald to the 
project who developed a new disk formatting concept that 
used a File Allocation Table (FAT) . The FAT controlled 
the sequence of data stored on a disk and improved the 
performance of disk operations. The company used the 
concept of a file allocation table in Microsoft Stand- 
alone Disk BASIC. Also in a Microsoft operating system 
project called MIDAS and later in QDOS by Tim Paterson 
of Seattle Computer Products . 

Microsoft appointed Steve Mood as general manager 
to replace Richard Weiland who had left the company in 
September 1977. With the arbitrator's settlement of the 
MITS/Microsoft dispute in September, Microsoft now 
closed a number of contracts that had been pending with 
other companies. Microsoft was starting to dominate the 
BASIC language market by the end of 1977. The new major 
manufacturers of microcomputers such as Apple Computer 
and Commodore had licensed BASIC interpreters from 
Microsoft. A large contract was with Radio Shack. 
Microsoft hired Bob O'Rear in 1977 who then started 
adapting Microsoft BASIC to the Radio Shack TRS-80 . The 
interpreter would be an alternative to the limited one 
developed internally by Radio Shack. 

By early 1978 the market place had changed. The 
MITS Altair computer had lost its dominant role. 

longer significant. Microsoft required additional space 
and started to question Albuquerque as a location for 
expansion. In March 1978 Microsoft decided to relocate 
from Albuquerque to Bellevue, a city just east of 
Seattle in the state of Washington. The move was to take 

A number of chip makers such as Intel and National 

Richard Weiland had returned to Microsoft in January. He 
worked on the development of COBOL that Microsoft 
announced as COBOL-80 for the CP/M operating system at a 
price of S750 in April 1978. The Heath Company also 


6/12 Pai-t II 1970's - The Altair/Apple era 

purchased Microsoft BRSIC and FORTRAN software in 1978. 
Then the Heath Company software developer, Gordon Letwin 
joined Microsoft in late 1978. 

In mid 1978 Vern Rataurn of GRT (Great Records and 
Tapes) convinced Gates to supply software to the company 
for distribution to the retail market. Microsoft 
released versions of BASIC interpreters for the 
Processor Technology Sol and Southwest Technical 
Products computers. Microsoft also released the enhanced 
Level II BftSIC that had been under development for the 
Radio Shack: TRS-80 computer. 

In June 1978, Gates negotiated an agreement with 
Japanese entrepreneur Kazuhiko |Kay) Nishi and his ASCII 
Corporation. Nishi would be the exclusive agent for 
Microsoft products in East Asia and receive a lucrative 
30 percent commission on all sales. This resulted in the 
establishment of Microsoft's first international sales 
office in November, ASCII Microsoft. 

Microsoft started developing a simulator program 
and a BASIC interpreter for the new Intel 8086 
microprocessor in 1978. Microsoft hired Jim Lane to 
develop the simulator software. Bob O'Rear also worked 
on the simulator software and the 8085 BASIC for the new 
microprocessor. With Motorola announcing the 68000 and 
Zilog the Z-8000, 16-bit microprocessors were going to 
be the future technology 

1978, Gates and Allen had a staff of twelve employees. 
Microsoft had also finished its first million-dollar

Microsoft had close to 100 OEM customers for 
BASIC, FORTRAN-80 and COBOL-80 in March 1979. They also 
had hired Steve Smith as director of marketing . Work had 
started on the development of a BASIC compiler and a 
Pascal programming language. 

In the Far East, agent Kay Nishi was generating 
additional lucrative revenue for Microsoft. Two large 
Japanese companies, NEC (Wippon Electric Company) and

interest in developing other software products for the 
Apple II computers. Apple II computer sales, and more 
important to Microsoft, software sales for the Apple II, 
were increasing significantly. This resulted in the 
concept by Paul Allen to create an interface card for 
the Apple computer that would allow the CP/M versions of 
FORTRAN and COBOL to operate on the machine. Microsoft 
hired Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products as a 
consultant to develop the Apple II card. Microsoft also 
hired Neil Konzen, sn Apple computer programming 
enthusiast to develop the software. The function of the 
card evolved from an interface for Microsoft FORTRAN-80 
and COBOL-80, to a general interface for the Digital 
Research CP/M operating system. The card used a Z-80 
microprocessor and Microsoft named it the Z-80 SoftCard. 
Microsoft had to pay Gary Kildall of Digital Research 
$50,000 for a license to use the CP/M operating system. 
Subsequently Microsoft hired Don Burtis to improve the 
card design. 

Microsoft completed the 8086 BASIC interpreter 
developed by Bob O'Rear and introduced it in June 1979. 
Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products had completed 
a card system for the S-100 bus using the new Intel 8086 

system and Microsoft tested the new BASIC interpreter 
using a Cromemco computer. Then Microsoft demonstrated 
the new BASIC interpreter for the 8086 at the June 1979 
National Computer Conference in New York City. 

In August 1979 Gates visited EDS (Electronic Data 
Systems) in Dallas. EDS was a computer service company 


Microsoft in the 1970's 6/15 

for mainframes owned by H. Ross Perot . Rs a result of 
these discussions, EDS made an offer to purchase 
Microsoft. However Microsoft rejected the offer due to 
financial differences. 

Microsoft released in 1979, a Macro Assembler 
language for the Intel 8080 and Zilog Z-80 
microprocessors in Rugust, a BASIC Compiler with a price 
of 5395 and the Edit-80 text editor with a price of 
5120. 

Microsoft's revenue had reached 52-4 million with 
a staff of 2 a employees by the end of its 1979 fiscal 
year. The revenue and number of employees had doubled 
approximately, during the past year.

Chapter 7 Other Software in the 1970' s 

7.1... Operating Systems 

Prior to the introduction of disk drives, software 
was developed to facilitate the loading or "booting" at 
startup. An example of this is the Motorola mini 
operating system for automatic loading called "Mikbug." 

IBM developed the floppy disk drive in 1971 and 
the hard disk drive in 1973. Shugart Associates released 
their 8-inch floppy disk drive in 1973. With the 
availability of disk drives, many manufacturers released 
their own operating systems. However, the dominant 
system was CP/M from Digital Research. 

Digital Research 

Gary A. Kildall received a Ph.D., in computer 
science from the University of Washington, founded 
Microcomputer Applications Associates (MAA) and became a 
professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in California 
in 1972 . MAA was the predecessor to the founding of 
Intergalactic Digital Research by Kildall and his wife 
Dorothy McEwen, in 197 6. The company name changed to 
Digital Research, Inc., in 1979. 

In 1972, Kildall purchased an Intel 4004 
microprocessor and developed emulator and assembler 
programs for it on an IBM System/360 computer at the 
naval school. While continuing to teach at the naval 
school, Kildall' s MAA provided consulting services to 
Intel. This resulted in the development of an emulator 
for the Intel 8008 microprocessor to run on Intel's DEC 
PDP-10 time sharing system. Kildall also developed a new 
systems programming language called PL/M (Programming 
Language for Microcomputers) that was released in 1973. 
Around this time MAA made a proposal to Intel to develop 
a disk operating system for the 8000 series 
microprocessors . 

Intel rejected the proposed operating system. 
However, Kildall continued working on the program and 
named the new operating system Control Program for 


7/1 


7/2 Part II 1970's-TheAltair/Appleera 

Microprocessors (CP/M) . Initially, it would form the 
basis for the resident programming of PL/M for 8080- 
based computers with 16K bytes of main memory and 
Shugart' s new disk drive. This reguired the design of a 
disk controller and the assistance of a friend John 
Torode to get it working. The operating system had 
features such as commands and file naming conventions 
similar to those used on the DEC PDP-10 system. CP/M 
included a single-user file system, and used recoverable 
directory information to determine storage allocation, 
rather than a traditional linked-list organization. MAA 
completed CP/M in 1974 and retailed the program for $70. 
It soon became successful as the dominant 8-bit 
operating system for microcomputers using the Intel 8000 
and Zilog Z-80 series of microprocessors. 

In the mid 1970' s after several implementations on 
computer systems with different hardware interfaces, the 
CP/M software was restructured. CP/M was decomposed into 
two parts : an invariant part that was written in PL/M 
and a small variant part was written in assembly 
language. This small variant module for interfacing to 
various hardware platforms became known as the Basic 
Input/Output System (BIOS) . Computer suppliers and end 
users could now create their own physical input/output 
drivers for CP/M. 

In late 1979, Digital released an enhanced Version 
2.0 of CP/M that sold for $150. The program had been 
completely redesigned to support floppy disk drives and 
high-capacity Winchester disk drives. All disk 
parameters were moved from the invariant part to a table 
driven concept in the variant module. 

Kildall also developed other programs for use with 
CP/M. Some of those were an assembly language, text 
editor and various utilities. Digital Research also 
developed a multi-terminal operating system called MP/M 
(Multi-Programming Monitor) . It provided real-time 
processing with multiprogramming and multi-terminal 
features . The program was compatible with CP/M and sold 
for $300. 


Other Software m the 1 970 ' s 7/3 

Apple Computer 

DOS (Disk Operating System) Version 3.1 was the 
operating system released with the Apple Disk II drive 
in June 1978. The disk had 35 tracks with thirteen 256 
byte sectors on each track for a total storage capacity 
of 113K bytes . Earlier versions were not completely 
functional and therefore not released. Apple released a 
more stable version, DOS 3.2 in mid-1979. 

DOS 3.3 evolved from the release of Apple Pascal 
programming language in 1979. This release changed the 
35 track disk format to sixteen 256 byte sectors with a 
total disk storage capacity of 143K bytes. Apple 
developed a utility called Boot 13 to boot the 13- 
sector-per-track disks. 

Other Operating Systems 

Bill Levy developed PT-DOS for Process Technology 
around 1976/77. Radio Shack released TRSDOS for the TRS- 
80 Mini Disk System in the late 1970' s. It was not 
compatible with CP/M. 

7.2 ... Programming Languages 

BASIC 

A history of the BASIC programming language is 
provided by Thomas E. Kurtz in History of Programming 
Languages 36], pp. 515-549 and by John G. Kemeny and 
Thomas E. Kurtz in Back to BASIC [115], pp. 1-23. A time 
chart depicting the evolution of BASIC is provided by 
Russ Lockwood in a periodical article entitled The 
Genealogy of BASIC [397] . Bill Gates of Microsoft has 
provided an interesting history of BASIC in a periodical 
article entitled The 25th Birthday of BASIC [394] . 
Reference Section 2.2 for the initial development of 
BASIC and Chapter 6 for the Microsoft development of 
BASIC interpreters for the Altair and other 
microcomputers . 

Dartmouth College made a significant upgrade to 
their BASIC compiler with the release of version six in 
September 1971. In 1974, the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI) formed a committee to develop standards 


7/4 Part II 1970's-TheAltair/Appleera 

for the BASIC programming language. This resulted in the 
release of a standard for Minimal BASIC in 1976 and its 
official approval in 1978. Work then proceeded on a 
standard for a "full" BASIC. Dartmouth released version 
seven of its BASIC compiler in 1979. 

Various hardware manufacturers such as Apple 
Computer, Digital Group, IBM, PolyMorphic Systems and 
Processor Technology developed BASIC languages for their 
own computers. However, Tiny BASIC and the following are 
some of the more significant releases. 

Dennis Allison who was a member of the computer 
science faculty at Stanford University developed Tiny 
BASIC. The initial version of Tiny BASIC developed by 
Allison was a simplified BASIC oriented to younger 
programmers. The program reguired less than 4K bytes of 
memory. The PCC Newsletter and the initial issue of Dr. 
Dobb ' s Journal of Computer Calisthenics and Orthodontia 
in January 1976 provided a detailed description of an 
extended version of the software. Other programmers such 
as Tom Pittman and Li-Chen Wang developed and 
distributed variations of the program for different 
computers [393] . 

Robert Uiterwyk developed SwTPC BASIC for the 
SwTPC 68 00 microcomputer in 1975. SwTPC provided low- 
cost BASIC programs at $1 per kilobyte. A 4K BASIC 
interpreter cost $4, 8K $8 and 12K $12. 

Gordon E. Eubanks developed E-BASIC while working 
on a masters degree in computer science at the Naval 
Postgraduate School in California. Eubanks was 
associated with Gary Kildall and E-BASIC became widely 
used with the CP/M operating system. Gordon Eubanks, 
associates Alan Cooper and Keith Parsons developed C- 
BASIC and founded Compiler Systems, Inc., to market the 
software. Eubanks subseguently sold the Compiler Systems 
company to Digital Research and became one of Digital's 
vice presidents. C-BASIC was a pseudocompiled language 
developed in 1977 for IMSAI and was included with the 
CP/M operating system in 1979. 

Radio Shack released Level-I BASIC with the TRS-80 
Model I computer in August 1977. Steven Leininger 
developed the interpreter by adapting it from Tiny 
BASIC. Radio Shack released Level II BASIC developed by 


Other Software m the 1 970 ' s 7/5 

Microsoft for business and advance applications in 1978 
and an enhanced Level III version in 1979. 

c 

Dennis M. Ritchie created the C language at AT&T's 
Bell Laboratories in 1972 . The language was designed to 
be portable, fast and compact. The UNIX operating system 
was later reprogrammed using the C language. 

FORTRAN 

Reference Section 1.4 for the initial development 
of FORTRAN. Microsoft developed a FORTRAN-80 compiler 
for the Intel 8080 microprocessor. They announced the 
program in April 1977 and sold it for $500. 

Pascal 

Niklaus Wirth developed the Pascal language at the 
ETH (Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule) in Zurich 
Switzerland. Pascal evolved from the ALGOL 60 
programming language. The main development principals 
were to provide a language suitable for structured 
programming and teaching. Wirth drafted a preliminary 
version in 1968 and the first compiler became 
operational in 1970. 

Kenneth L. Bowles directed the development of UCSD 
Pascal at the University of California in San Diego. 
UCSD released the program to users in August 1977 as a 
complete interactive system for microcomputers and 
minicomputers. It was initially released for Digital 
Equipment Corporation (DEC) LSI-11 or other PDP-11 
processors, 8080 and Z80 microprocessors. The software 
system cost $200. Bill Atkinson of Apple Computer, 
adapted the UCSD Pascal for the Apple II computer in 
1979. 


7/6 Part II 1970's-TheAltair/Appleera 

Other Languages 

Gary Kildall of Digital Research, developed PL/M 
(Programming Language for Microcomputers) for Intel in 
1972 . PL/M was a system programming language that 
developed to provide a simpler alternative to assembly 
language for the Intel 8000 series of 8-bit 
microprocessors. It was a refinement of the Stanford 
University XPL compiler writing language with elements 
from Burroughs Corporation's ALGOL and IBM's PL/I. Intel 
marketed the program for the 8000 series of 
microprocessors in 1973. 

BCPL and MESA were systems programming languages 
developed at the Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) 
for the Alto personal computer in the early 1970 ' s. 

Alan Kay developed Smalltalk at the Learning 
Research Group (LRG) of Xerox PARC in 1972. It was the 
software part of the Dynabook concept and was created 
for the Alto computer. It is one of the first object- 
oriented languages and used interactive graphical 
concepts to create a user friendly environment. 

7.3 ... Word Processors 

Bravo was a word processing program developed by 
Butler Lampson and Charles Simonyi for the Xerox Alto 
personal computer in the early 1970' s. It was one of the 
earliest word processors to feature What-You-See-Is- 
What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) text display on the terminal 
screen. Between 1976 and 1978 improvements were 
incorporated by Simonyi in a new version of the word 
processor called BravoX. During this time Tim Mott and 
Larry Tesler developed a text editor called Gypsy that 
included a new cut-and-paste feature. 

The Electric Pencil evolved from a public domain 
software package called Software Package One (SP-1) . The 
package was distributed by the Southern California 
Computer Society (SCCS) in the fall of 1975. Michael 
Shrayer improved the editor portion of the package and 
called it Extended Software Package 1 (ESP-1) . A further 
upgrade of ESP-1 was called Executer. ESP-1 and Executer 
were the basis for the first word processor for a 


Other Software m the 1 970 ' s 7/7 

microcomputer. Shrayer named it "The Electric Pencil" 
and it became available in December 1976. The first 
version was written for the MITS Altair microcomputer. 
Shrayer founded the Michael Shrayer Software company and 
other versions of the program were developed for various 
microcomputers. An improved version, The Electric Pencil 
II was announced in early 1978 . 

Seymour Rubinstein was the director of marketing 
for IMSAI when he left to start his own company, 
MicroPro International Corporation in late 1978 . He 
hired Bob Barnaby, a programmer who had also worked at 
IMSAI and created a program called NED (New Editor) . 
Barnaby extended this program into a full-scale word 
processor for microcomputers. Barnaby developed two 
programs, a video text editor named Word-Master and a 
sort /merge program named Super-Sort. MicroPro released 
Word-Master at a price of $150 in August 1978 and then 
an improved version named Word-Star at a price of $495 
in June 1979. Word-Star was a success and became a 
dominant word processor used on early CP/M 
microcomputers . 

Apple Writer was created for the Apple II computer 
by Paul Lutus , at a mountain cabin in the wilderness of 
Oregon in 1978. Lutus sold the program to Apple Computer 
for a flat fee of $7,500. Apple Computer released the 
program that sold for $75 in 1979. It featured automatic 
search and replacement of words or phrases, 
justification of text and uppercase and lowercase type. 

John Draper developed EasyWriter for the Apple II 
computer in 1978 . Shortly after, Draper met Bill Baker 
of Information Unlimited Software (IUS) at the third 
West Coast Computer Faire in the spring of 1979. This 
meeting resulted in an agreement being reached for IUS 
to market the program. 

Magic Wand was introduced as an easy-to-use word 
processor in late 1979 by Small Business Applications, 
Inc . 


7/8 Part II 1970's-TheAltair/Appleera 
7.4 ... Spreadsheets 

Daniel S . Bricklin conceived the concept for a 
spreadsheet during his studies for an MBA at the Harvard 
Business School in the spring of 1978 . Bricklin already 
had a degree in electrical and computer science from 
MIT. He had also been a software engineer at Digital 
Eguipment Corporation (DEC) . The impetus for this 
concept was the desire to find a way of utilizing a 
computer to facilitate the financial analysis of varied 
business situations . A prototype of the program was 
written in BASIC and called Calculedger, a combination 
of calculator and ledger. 

It was at MIT that Bricklin had become friends 
with Robert Frankston who would co-develop the software 
for the spreadsheet program. Frankston had done some 
programming for Daniel Fylstra of Personal Software, who 
loaned Bricklin and Frankston an Apple II computer to 
develop the software. 

Bricklin and Frankston formed their own company 
called Software Arts, Inc., in January 1979 to complete 
the development of the spreadsheet software. The program 
was now called VisiCalc, that is an acronym for Visible 
Calculator. Bricklin developed many of the concepts, 
data structures, documentation and specifications. 
Frankston did most of the program coding using assembler 
language and macros. Assembler was used to improve the 
speed and to allow the program to run on a 2 4K byte 
Apple II computer, 32K bytes with a disk. The limited 
memory restricted the spreadsheet to 63 columns by 254 
rows and reduced the number of features incorporated. 
Recalculation was limited to across rows or down 
columns, column widths could be varied, but had to be 
the same and text could not span columns . 

Fylstra offered to sell the program to Apple 
Computer in January 1979 for $1 million. However Steven 
Jobs and Mike Markkula rejected the offer. Bill Gates of 
Microsoft is also reported to have rejected an offer to 
purchase the program. However, subseguently Arthur Rock 
and Venrock Associates assisted in financing Personal 
Software and the new program. 


Other Software m the 1 970 ' s 7/9 

Software Arts signed an agreement with Fylstra of 
Personal Software, Inc., to market VisiCalc in April 
1979. VisiCalc was introduced at the West Coast Computer 
Faire in May, demonstrated at the National Computer 
Conference in June, advertised in the September issue of 
Byte (page 51) and released in October for the Apple II 
computer. VisiCalc was priced at $99.50 then guickly 
increased to $150 after sales increased dramatically. 
One limitation was that it could not run on the CP/M 
operating system, however it was an instant success. 
The term "killer application" has been credited to the 
success of VisiCalc. It also became a significant factor 
in helping to sell Apple II computers. 

7.5 ... Databases 

Lyall Morill developed a simple database program 
for microcomputers called WHATSIT? in 1977. WHATSIT? is 
an acronym for "Wow! How' d All That Stuff get In There?" 
Morill improved WHATSIT? and Information Unlimited 
Software (IUS) introduced the program at the second West 
Coast Computer Faire in the spring of 1978 . Bill Baker 
had previously founded IUS while attending college. 

C. Wayne Ratliff was an engineer who adapted a 
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory mainframe database to his 
IMSAI 8 08 microcomputer in his spare time. On 
completion of the software in August 1979, he named it 
Vulcan. The software was marketed by Software 
Consultation Design and Production (SCDP) company and 
advertised in the Byte magazine at a price of $490 
without success. The software was subseguently marketed 
by Ashton-Tate who changed the name to dBASE II in 1981. 

Other early database programs were Condor, FMS 80 
and Selector.

Games 

Various games had been developed for use on larger 
computers in the 1950' s and 1960's as described in 
Sections 1.4 and 2.6. Then in the early 1970's video 
games that used dedicated processors were introduced and 
became very popular. Most of these video games used high 
resolution graphics and sound effects that would 
subseguently be implemented on more powerful 
microcomputers . 

Nolan K. Bushnell developed the first commercial 
video game called Computer Space in 1970. It evolved 
from his interest in games and his previous exposure to 
the Space Wars game at the University of Utah. Bushnell 
subseguently founded Atari Corporation (see Section 
4.6) . This led to Stephen Wozniak developing an Apple 
Computer version of a game called Breakout that he and 
Steven Jobs had worked on for Atari. Also released at 
Apple Computer was a program called Lunar Lander 
developed by Bob Bishop. Bill Budge also developed a 
number of game programs, such as Penny Arcade, that he 
sold to Apple Computer in 1979. 

In the early 1970' s, Will Crowther developed a 
non-graphic fantasy game that was set in a cavern world 
with hidden treasure and challenging features such as 
dragons, flying horses and trolls. Crowther released the 
game on the ARPANET. The program was then refined by Don 
Woods and became known as the Adventure game. It became 
highly popular and formed the basis for personal 
computer Adventure games by Adventureland International 
and Microsoft. 

Adventure Land was one of the earliest text 
adventure games for personal computers. Scott Adams 
developed the program for the Radio Shack TRS-80 
computer in 1978 . Adventure Land reguired a player to 
search through a magic realm that had wild animals, 
perils and mysteries to locate treasures . Adams founded 
Adventure International in 1978 to produce, be a 
distributor and publisher of other computer games . The 
game was adapted for the Apple II and other games such 


Other Software m the 1 970 ' s 7/11 

as Laser Ball, Fire Copter and Pirate Adventure 
followed . 

Peter R. Jennings developed Microchess initially, 
for the MOS Technology KIM-1 microcomputer in 197 6. 
Jennings sold the source code for $15. Shortly after, 
Daniel Fylstra and Jennings founded Personal Software, 
Inc. to market Microchess and other game programs. 

Another chess playing program was SARGON, that was 
released around 1978. It was developed by Dan and Kathe 
Spracklen. 

Toru Iwatani designed the Pac-Man game at a 
Japanese company called Namco Limited. It was first 
introduced in Japan in the late 1970 ' s. Atari licensed 
the rights for Pac-Man and it became very successful in 
North America. 

Other Software 

Radio Shack issued a variety of software in the 
late 1970' s for their TRS-80 systems. Some of the 
programs were: General Ledger, Inventory Control System, 
Real Estate, Statistical Analysis and various computer 
games. The programs were provided on cassettes and 5- 
inch floppy disks. 

Stephen Wozniak developed SWEET16 in 1977 as an 
interpreter program that was contained in the initial 
Apple II ROM memory chip. Wozniak called it a 16-bit 
"metaprocessor " [402] . It was used to manipulate 16-bit 
pointer data and its arithmetic on the 8-bit Apple II 
computer . 

Mitchell Kapor developed Tiny Troll in 1978/79 
with help from Eric Rosenfeld of MIT. The program 
displayed line charts, multiple regressions, statistical 
analysis information and had a text editor. The software 
formed the basis for the later development of VisiPlot 
and VisiTrend programs .

Conclusion 

In the 1970' s, software had developed in 
conjunction with personal computer technology. Initially 
it had focused on programming languages such as BASIC, 
and operating systems such as CP/M to support disk drive 
technology. However in the late 1970' s a change in user 
orientation from the technical enthusiast to the mass 
market consumer occurred. This was supported by the 
release of application software such as the VisiCalc 
spreadsheet .

Chapter 8 Microprocessors in the 1980' s 

8.1... Intel 

Microprocessors 

The iAPX 432 (Intel Advanced Processor 
Architecture) which was now a 32-bit microprocessor, was 
introduced in February 1981. Principals in the 
development were William Lattin and Justin Rattner. The 
chip was an advanced design with an innovative 
architecture. It supported data store using multiple 
pointer levels, fault tolerance, memory error 
correction, multiprocessing and object-oriented 
software. The microprocessor was described as a 
micromainframe computer in the May 3, 1982 issue of 
Fortune magazine. However, due to performance 
deficiencies the product was discontinued. 

Intel announced the 80186 and 80188 high 
integration 16-bit internal data path microprocessors in 
1982 . Both processors were designed for embedded 
applications in computer peripherals and other 
electronic products. 

The 8028 6 microprocessor was introduced in 
February 1982 and was four times more powerful than the 
8088. The chip has 134,000 transistors, a 16-bit 
internal data path and at a clock speed of 8 MHz it has 
a rating of 1.2 MIPS (million instructions per second) . 
The microprocessor featured on-chip memory management to 
support multitasking. It also had an on-chip security 
system for data protection. The memory addressability is 
16 megabytes and the microprocessor is available at 
clock freguencies of 8 , 10 and 12.5 MHz. The price at 
introduction was $360. This microprocessor was selected 
by IBM for the PC AT computer released in August 198 4. 

A group of engineers led by John Crawford 
developed Intel's 80386DX microprocessor. It had full 
32-bit capability and preserved software compatibility 
with the previous 8086 and 80286 architectures. The 
8038 6DX was introduced in October 1985 and was 
approximately fifteen times more powerful than the 8 088. 


8/3 


8/4 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

The chip has 275,000 transistors, a 32-bit internal data 
path and at a clock speed of 16 MHz a rating of 6 MIPS. 
The memory addressability is 4 gigabytes and the 
microprocessor became available at clock freguencies of 
16, 20, 25 and 33 MHz. The price at introduction was 
$299. 

The 8038 6DX was selected by Compag for the Deskpro 
computer released in September 198 6. This was the first 
product application of the microprocessor. Intel had 
tried to get IBM to incorporate the new microprocessor 
in their product line. However, IBM had concerns 
regarding the processors power affecting their 
microcomputer sales and were therefore slow in adopting 
the 80386. Initially the 80386 microprocessor was not 
second sourced by Intel to other competitors, other than 
IBM for a portion of its internal use. The 80386 became 
a very successful product and started to contribute 
significantly to the company profits . 

The 8038 6SX microprocessor was introduced in June 

1988. The chip has 275,000 transistors, a 32-bit 
internal bus with a 16-bit external bus and at a clock 
speed of 16 MHz a rating of 2.5 MIPS. The memory 
addressability is 16 megabytes and the microprocessor is 
available at clock freguencies of 16, 20, 25 and 33 MHz. 

The 8048 6DX microprocessor was introduced in April 

1989. The chip has 1.2 million transistors, 1.0 micron 
minimum feature size and a 32-bit bus. This was the 
first Intel processor to incorporate a Level 1 (LI) 
cache of 8 KB for faster data access. At a clock speed 
of 25 MHz it has a rating of 20 MIPS. The microprocessor 
included an integrated floating-point unit. The memory 
addressability is 4 gigabytes and the microprocessor 
became available at clock freguencies of 25, 33, 50, 60, 
75, and 100 MHz. The price at introduction was $950. 

Coprocessors 

The concept for a coprocessor evolved at Intel 
from the 8086 microprocessor in 1976. This resulted in a 
floating-point extension to the 8086 instruction set and 
a systems interface architecture. In 1987 the 
development of the coprocessor was assigned to the Intel 
design center in Haifa, Israel. 


Microprocessors in the 1980' s 8/5 

The 8087 math coprocessor added a set of floating- 
point instructions to the 8086/88. It was the first 
implementation of the IEEE standard for floating-point 
mathematics. Use of the coprocessor resulted in a 
significant increase in the speed of mathematical 
computations. The 8087 coprocessor was released in June 
1980. Intel announced the 82786 graphics coprocessor in 
May 1986. 

Corporate & Other Activities 

Competitive pressures in the microprocessor market 
from companies such as Motorola and Zilog, resulted in 
the implementation of a sales campaign called "Operation 
Crush" in early 1980. Intel had been loosing market 
share, mainly to Motorola whose microprocessor products 
were perceived as being superior. Numerous activities 
were initiated to communicate the overall advantages 
offered by the company, and the sales personnel were 
assigned goals to increase the number of design wins for 
the use of Intel chips in customer products. By the end 
of 198 0, the campaign became very successful. One major 
design win with far reaching conseguences for Intel, was 
in Boca Raton, Florida for the IBM Personal Computer. 

Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) negotiated 
a ten year technological exchange agreement, and AMD 
became a second source for the 8088 microprocessor in 
February 1982. This was largely the effect of a desire 
by IBM to have an alternate source for the 
microprocessor in its new personal computer. 

IBM purchased 12 percent of Intel Corporation for 
$250 million in December 1982. Intel was having 
financial problems due to intense competition from 
Japanese manufacturers of memory chips. Then in 1983-8 4, 
IBM increased its investment in Intel to 20 percent. 

In 1984 Intel approved a project for a line of 
parallel processing supercomputers. The company also 
licensed AMD as a second source for the 80286 in 1984. 

The semiconductor industry had been enjoying a 
boom market until mid-1984, when demand slowed 
dramatically. This resulted in excess capacity across 
the industry and prices collapsed between 1985 and 198 6. 
At Intel, a reduced demand for microprocessors and 


8/6 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

termination of the company's DRAM chip business resulted 
in significant losses in 1986. This resulted in plant 
closings and the termination of over 8,000 employees. 
However, in 1987 conditions improved. Intel started to 
report profitable income and Andrew Grove became the 
chief executive officer. 

During 198 6, Intel concluded a technological 
exchange agreement with IBM. IBM received rights to 
manufacture up to half of its own requirements for the 
Intel 8038 6 microprocessor and to develop an enhanced 
design for its own use and external sales. Intel 
received a number of IBM technologies, such as advance 
chip packaging. IBM started reducing its investment in 
Intel Corporation in 198 6, and completed its divestiture 
of Intel shares due to its own financial problems in 
December 1987. 

Robert Noyce, who had been moving towards semi- 
retirement, accepted a position as chief executive 
officer of SEMATECH, Inc., in mid-198 8. SEMATECH is an 
acronym for SEmiconductor MAnuf acturing TECHnology. The 
company was founded by the U.S. Government and a group 
of leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturers to conduct 
research that would help combat competition from Japan. 

8.2... Motorola 

Motorola introduced 10 and 12 MHz versions of the 
MC68000 microprocessor by the end of 1981. The company 
then introduced the MC68010 in 1982 and the 32-bit 
MC68020 in 1984. The MC68020 used 2.5 micron technology, 
had 200,000 transistors, a 256 byte cache and executed 
instructions at 2.5 MIPS. Clock speeds are 16-33 MHz. 

The MC68030 32-bit unit has all the features of 
the MC68020 plus a paged memory management unit, 
separate 256 byte caches for data and instructions and 
additional enhancements . It executes instructions at 12 
MIPS and clock speeds are 16-50 MHz. The MC68030 was 
introduced in 198 7 and was used on the Apple Macintosh 
IIx computer. 

Motorola announced the 88000 family of Reduced 
Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessors in 


Microprocessors in the 1980' s 8/7 

1988. They were designed for applications such as 
multiprocessing and high performance graphics. 

The MC68040 is a 32-bit microprocessor that 
executes instructions at 20 MIPS. It contains 1.2 
million transistors, has a 4K byte instruction cache, 4k 
byte data cache and a floating-point unit. Clock speeds 
are 25-40 MHz. The MC68040 was announced in April 1989. 


8.3... Other Microprocessors 


The National Semiconductor 16032 was a 
microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus and a 32- 
bit internal bus. It was announced in 1981. The 32032 
was the first full 32-bit microprocessor. In 1987, 
National Semiconductor acguired Fairchild Semiconductor 
that had been having problems. 

The Western Design Center 65802 and 65816 
microprocessors were designed by Bill Mensch and 
announced in 1984. The W65C816 is a 16-bit 
microprocessor that is used in the Apple IIGS computer. 

Gordon Campbell who had previously been with Intel 
Corporation founded Chips and Technologies, Inc. The 
company started by producing low cost chip sets for the 
IBM PC AT computer. 

The Zilog Z-80000 is a 32-bit microprocessor and 
the Z280 is a 16-bit version of the Z-80 that was 
announced in 198 7. 

RISC Microprocessors 

John Cocke developed the primary concepts for the 
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) technology at 
IBM starting in the 1960's. It evolved from his research 
on optimizing the interaction between hardware and 
software. Cocke determined that the overall speed of 
execution could be increased by reducing the number of 
complicated instructions to a relatively small set of 
simple optimized instructions. 

The RISC architecture was first implemented on two 
experimental computers and on the IBM 8 01 minicomputer 
in 1978. Then in 1980, IBM's Austin laboratory developed 
the ROMP (Research Office products Microprocessor) RISC 


8/8 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

microprocessor for the office products division. The 
original intent was to use the microprocessor in a 
networked office workstation. The first IBM personal 
computer to use the ROMP microprocessor was the PC RT 
workstation introduced in January 198 6. IBM's mainframe 
and personal computer divisions did not support the 
application of RISC technology on their products. This 
allowed other companies to exploit the technology during 
the last half of the 1980' s. 

David Patterson from the University of California 
at Berkeley, who after evaluating the complexity of the 
DEC VAX computer instruction set, developed the RISC-I 
microprocessor in 1980. John L. Hennessy also did 
research on RISC microprocessors at Stanford University, 
and with Skip Stritter, also from Stanford and John 
Moussouris of IBM, they founded MIPS Computer Systems in 
1984. MIPS released the 32-bit R2000 RISC 
microprocessor, that had 185,000 transistors in 1986. 

The SPARC RISC microprocessor was developed at Sun 
Microsystems by Anant Agrawal with assistance from 
Robert Garner, William Joy and David Patterson from the 
University of California at Berkeley. SPARC is an 
acronym for Scalable Processor Architecture. It was 
introduced by Sun in July 1987 and used on their 
SPARCstation 1 in 1989. 


8.4 ... Other Corporate Developments 

The Exxon corporation acguired Zilog Inc., in 1981 
then sold it to Zilog executives in 1989. 

Texas Instruments introduced its first single-chip 
digital signal processor (DSP), the TMS320 in 1982. This 
subsequently became a major product line for the 
company. 

In April 1985, AT&T purchased the assets of 
Synertek, Inc., a subsidiary of Honeywell for an 
estimated $25 million. Then in November a French 
company, Thomson-CSF purchased Mostek, a subsidiary of 
United Technologies for $70 million. 


Microprocessors in the 1980' s 8/9 

AMD started litigation to obtain a license as a 
second source for the 80386 microprocessor in 1987. 
Intel wanted to restrict the second sourcing of the 
microprocessor. However, the technological exchange 
agreement that Intel had agreed to with AMD in 1982 
would become a problem for Intel. During the litigation 
arbitration in 1989, AMD decided to make an independent 
clone design of the 80386.

Chapter 9 The IBM Corporation 

9.1 ... Introduction 

Prior to the introduction of the PC computer, IBM 
was in a state of transition. The US Federal Government 
Department of Justice was ending a long period of 
litigation into IBM's monopolistic and anti-competitive 
practices. Although IBM would be successful in its 
defense of the governments charges, it had caused 
problems for the corporation. A moderation in marketing 
and product line expansion had occurred during this 
sensitive period of litigation. This resulted in a loss 
of market share for IBM. This was also the period during 
which Thomas J. Watson Jr., relinguished his role as the 
head of IBM. The end of a family dynasty. During this 
time various organizational changes were evaluated. One 
of the areas of concern was the size of the organization 
and the effects of the bureaucracy on new initiatives . 
Conseguently the concept of the Independent Business 
Units (IBU's) was conceived. Frank T. Cary, the IBM 
chairman and chief executive officer was guoted as 
saying that the IBU's "might even teach an elephant 
(IBM) how to tap dance." 

The Entry Level Systems (ELS) unit in Boca Raton, 
Florida had responsibility for the low cost end of IBM's 
computer business . It was this division that introduced 
the unsuccessful IBM 5100 portable computer in September 
1975. William C. Lowe was the manager of IBM's Entry 
Level Systems Unit and was promoted to overall 
laboratory director in 1978 . 

It was during the period of 1975 to 1979 that the 
microcomputer market exploded. It started with the 
release of the Altair 8800 in January 1975, Commodore 
Pet in 1976, the Apple II and Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 
microcomputers in 1977. The microcomputers of the 1970 ' s 
were oriented to the hobbyist type of user. The 
"hackers" got satisfaction and were indeed fascinated by 
either the electronic or software complexity of building 
and operating their own computer. During the late 1970 ' s 
several microcomputer software releases were laying the 


9/1 


9/2 Part III 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 

foundation for the utilization of microcomputers by 
business. Those were the word processing program Word- 
Master in 1978, the Vulcan database in 1979 and of great 
significance, the financial spreadsheet program VisiCalc 
in 1979. However at this point in time the business 
market had not been penetrated to any extent. 

The dynamic growth of the microcomputer industry 
during the late 1970 ' s had not gone unnoticed at IBM. It 
was recognized by both corporate management and Lowe who 
initiated a detailed analysis. The leading producers of 
personal computers in 1979/80 were Apple Computer, 
Commodore and Tandy Radio Shack. However they had not 
released products that met the reguirements of either 
the small or corporate business market. This situation 
was prevalent in not only North America, but also in 
Europe and Asia. Lowe rationalized that the recognition 
of IBM as the major international computer manufacturer 
would be a key factor in the commercial acceptance of a 
personal computer by their company. 

In 1980, IBM released the Model 5120, a desktop 
version of the unsuccessful 5100 series of portable 
computers. However, this would not be successful either. 

During Lowe's analysis of IBM's possible entry 
into the personal computer market a number of concerns 
were identified. The majority of microcomputer 
developments had been by small entrepreneurial 
companies . Indeed a number of them such as Apple had 
been started in a garage. This of course was the 
opposite extreme from IBM with its extensive 
bureaucracy. The corporation also tended to engineer all 
of its components and software in house. This would 
result in higher than reguired guality levels that would 
escalate costs and delay development. Another 
significant factor was that IBM did not at that time 
have a microprocessor or the technology. Conseguently to 
compete in the personal computer market would reguire 
significant changes at IBM. An organization with greater 
entrepreneurial type of freedom for development, 
production and marketing was essential.

9/4 Part III 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 
9.2 ... PC Approval and Development 

In 1980, John R. Opel was the president of IBM, 
and all major projects required the approval of the 
Corporate Management Committee (CMC) at headquarters in 
Armonk, New York. In July, William Lowe presented to the 
CMC a personal computer market analysis, his concerns 
for the product development internally at IBM and two 
proposals for CMC consideration. One proposal was for 
IBM to either buy a personal computer company or a 
personal computer design, such as that from Atari. The 
second proposal was for IBM to design and build a new 
personal computer, but to do it outside of the normal 
corporate structure. To complete this proposal, he 
requested authorization to assemble a small task force 
of hand-picked engineers . This group would produce a 
prototype within thirty days for demonstration to the 
CMC. Shortly after, the approval to proceed with the new 
computer proposal was given. Corporate management was 
anxious to enter the desktop market, the timing had been 
right . 

Funding was granted for twelve engineers to 
develop the prototype and the detailed commercial 
proposals . The first person Lowe recruited was Bill 
Sydnes as manager for the engineering design. Sydnes had 
been manager of the IBM 5120 desktop computer which had 
not been a commercial success, but had been developed 
and produced on time. Lewis Eggebrecht was a principal 
in the systems engineering design and Joe Bauman was 
selected to develop the business and manufacturing 
plans. The rest of the task force was quickly selected. 
Another member of the founding group was Jack Sams who 
was in charge of software development. Sydnes and Sams 
had both been involved in a recent System/23 DataMaster 
business computer project. This project was delayed by 
nearly a year due to internal development of the BASIC 
interpreter. This resulted in the decision to use 
existing software from outside suppliers. Sams was 
involved in the initial selection and discussions with 
Microsoft as a major supplier for software in late July. 


The IBM Corporation 9/5 

The thirty day period to develop and present a 
prototype to the CMC required that a number of critical 
decisions be made very quickly by the task force. Some 
of those were the concept of an open bus architecture, a 
16-bit microprocessor, components and peripherals from 
competitive sources, a software operating system from 
outside IBM and marketing separate from IBM's sales 
organization. Maximizing the capabilities of the new 
computer without affecting the market for IBM's other 
low end computers required consideration. 

In early August Lowe demonstrated the prototype 
and presented his recommendations for IBM to enter the 
personal computer market to the Corporate Management 
Committee. The presentation was a success and the CMC 
gave approval to form a Product Development Group for 
the new computer. This group would become one of IBM's 
Independent Business Units. To maintain confidentiality, 
code names were assigned to the group and computer. The 
new group would be known as project "Chess" and the 
computer as the "Acorn" . The timetable required an 
additional review by the CMC in mid October and the 
computer to be shipped within one year. The next 
critical selection for Lowe was a manager for the new 
group. Lowe had aspirations for higher corporate levels 
and selected Philip D. Estridge to be the manager of 
Project Chess in early September. 

Don Estridge quickly doubled the engineering 
staff to twenty six. The final design time frame was 
extremely short. All of the components had to be state- 
of-the-art, but be existing and proven in the market. 
This resulted in a design that was not leading edge, but 
a conservative product for commercial production and 
customer acceptance. Some features such as the bus 
architecture and the keyboard evolved from the IBM 
System 23 DataMaster computer. David J. Bradley, who had 
worked on the System/23 DataMaster project, was assigned 
to develop the control code for the Basic Input/Output 
System (BIOS) . Fully functional prototypes had to be 
assembled for internal development and outside suppliers 
of peripherals and software. 

By late August IBM was planning for Microsoft 
Corporation to provide the programming languages . 


9/6 Part III 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 

However the task force was having a problem obtaining a 
16-bit version of the popular CP/M operating system from 
Digital Research, Inc. Then in late September Microsoft 
made a proposal to supply the operating system (see 
Section 12.2) and the programming languages. After CMC's 
final approval of the Chess computer project in October, 
IBM accepted the Microsoft proposals and a contract was 
signed in November. IBM also contracted with other 
software suppliers such as Personal Software to adapt 
VisiCalc for the new computer. 

Other IBM executives were selected to participate 
in the project and made significant contributions. H. L. 
Sparks headed marketing and sales, Joseph Sarubbi 
technical procurement, Dan Wilkie manufacturing and 
James D'Arezzo communications. D'Arezzo joined the 
project as manager of communications in January 1981. In 
March, William Lowe left Boca Raton and became a vice 
president of the Information Systems Division and 
general manager of the plant in Rochester, Minnesota. 
Then in June, Joe Bauman joined Lowe and was replaced by 
Dan Wilkie as the new director of manufacturing. 
D'Arezzo in conjunction with Lord, Geller, Federico and 
Einstein, a New York advertising agency used by IBM, 
created an advertising campaign based on the Charlie 
Chaplin tramp characture. The concept provided a 
friendly and uncomplicated user vision for the new 
computer introduction that was highly successful. During 
this time period the name IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) 
was selected for the computer. The estimate of the 
market for the IBM PC was 250,000 units over a five year 
period. In late July the CMC gave its final approval for 
the introduction of the IBM PC. 


9.3... The Original PC 


The following are details of the IBM Personal 
Computer (IBM PC) that was introduced on August 12, 1981 
in New York. 

The microprocessor selected was the Intel 8088 
operating at 4.77 MHz. Internally the microprocessor 
used the 16-bit instruction set of the Intel 8086 with 


The IBM Corporation 9/7 

an 8-bit external data communication bus. An additional 
socket was provided for the later utilization of the 
Intel 8087 numeric coprocessor. The memory had 40K bytes 
of ROM and 16K bytes of RAM, expandable to 64K on the 
system board and to 25 6K by adding memory expansion 
cards. The ROM incorporated the 32K Microsoft Cassette 
BASIC interpreter and the 8K Basic Input/Output System 
(BIOS) . The BIOS chip provided control of information 
transfer between elements of the hardware system. 

The basic system unit had five 62 pin expansion 
slots for additional memory, display, printer, 
communication and game adapter cards. One parallel 
printer port, one RS-232C serial port and a built in 
speaker were standard. A separate 83 key adjustable tilt 
keyboard was connected to the computer by a six foot 
coiled cable via a serial port. The keyboard 
incorporated a numeric key pad, ten special function 
keys and indicator lights to display shift states . The 
basic system also had an audio cassette recorder 
connector for mass storage. With a freguency modulator 
an ordinary television set could be used as a monitor. 

Two additional types of display were offered. A 
monochrome display with a Monochrome Display Adapter 
(MDA) for business and a color display with a Color 
Graphics Adapter (CGA) for home use. 

The IBM Monochrome Display used an 11.5 inch 
green-phosphor tube. This monitor reguired the 
monochrome adapter card that had 4K bytes of on-board 
memory. The monitor could display 25 rows of 8 
characters. The MDA system provided for 256 characters 
to support major languages and other items such as 
business graphics. 

The color/graphics monitor adapter enabled 
connection to a RGB (red-green-blue) monitor, a color 
television or a black and white monitor. The adapter had 
16K bytes of on-board memory and could display two modes 
of text and three modes of graphics. The first mode of 
text was 25 rows of 40 characters for color televisions 
and composite monitors. The second text mode was 25 rows 
of 80 characters for RGB monitors. The low resolution 
graphics mode was 100 rows of 160 pixels with 16 colors, 
but was not supported by IBM. The medium resolution 


9/8 Part III 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 

graphics was 200 rows of 320 pixels with 4 colors. The 
high resolution graphics mode was 200 rows of 640 pixels 
using a white-on-black image. 

The basic unit had provision for two 5.25 inch 
floppy disk drives manufactured by the Tandon 
Corporation, The disks were 160K byte single-sided, 
soft-sectored and double density. The disk operating 
system was IBM PC-DOS developed by Microsoft. 

The printer was an Epson MX-80 with an IBM label. 
The unit printed bi-directionally at 80 characters per 
second, with a 9 by 9 dot matrix and a choice of 12 type 
styles . 

Three forms of BASIC were developed by Microsoft 
and offered by IBM: Cassette BASIC (standard) , Disk 
BASIC and Advanced BASIC, also known as BASICA. Some of 
the other software available when the PC computer was 
released were: VisiCalc from Personal Software, three 
accounting programs from Peachtree Software, EasyWriter 
word processor from Information Unlimited Software and 
from Microsoft a Pascal compiler and a fantasy- 
simulation game called Adventure. IBM also indicated 
that they would offer Digital Research's CP/M-86 
operating system and SofTech Microsystems UCSD p-System 
which included UCSD Pascal. Communications software was 
also available to communicate with other computers and 
for connection to services such as the Dow Jones 
News/Retrieval Service and The Source. 

The basic system unit with 16K bytes of RAM and 
keyboard sold for $1,565. A system unit with 48K bytes 
of RAM, keyboard, single floppy disk drive and disk- 
drive adapter card was $2,235. A monochrome video 
display was $345 and the printer $755. The combination 
monochrome display adapter and printer adapter was $335. 
The 16K, 32K and 64K byte memory expansion cards were 
$90, $325 and $540 respectively. 

A significant marketing decision for IBM was the 
use of mass merchandising by major retailers such as 
ComputerLand and Sears, Roebuck and Company to sell the 
computer. The company also set up a chain of IBM Product 
Centers in major cities as retail outlets. Large 
corporate accounts were handled by the Data Processing 
Division sales force. Another significant decision was 


The IBM Corporation 9/9 

the publishing of a Technical Reference manual for the 
IBM PC that provided details of all the system 
specifications. This was done to facilitate the 
development of adapter cards and programs by outside 
suppliers . 

The IBM PC was an outstanding success. IBM had 
orders for 30,000 systems from their own US employees on 
the announcement day. The only limiting factor on 
initial sales was the production capacity. Estridge had 
taken a group of 12 people in 1980 to a work force of 
9,500 in 1984. Estridge was named division director of 
the entry systems business unit in January 1982, and 
became a vice president of the new Systems Products 
Division and general manager of entry systems in January 
1983. By the end of 1983 IBM had sold 750,000 personal 
computers .

9.4 ... The Following Models 

IBM 9000 

The IBM 9000 Instruments System Computer was 
announced in May 1982 and displayed at the June 1982 
COMDEX show in Atlantic City. It was developed by a 
wholly owned subsidiary IBM Instruments Inc. and 
marketed as a laboratory instrumentation computer. 

The computer used a Motorola MC68000 
microprocessor operating at 8 MHz. The memory had 128K 
bytes of ROM and 12 8K bytes of RAM expandable to 5.2 
megabytes. The unit used a 32-bit Versabus bus standard 
developed by Motorola. An optional expansion board could 
accommodate up to five Versabus cards. 

The storage system could have up to 4 drives in 
any combination of 5.25 or 8-inch sizes. The monitor had 
a 12-inch green-on-black screen capable of displaying 30 
lines of 80 characters with a 480 by 768 pixel 
resolution. The unit had a separate 83-key keyboard, a 
57-key user-definable keypad on the main chassis and an 
optional 2 00 characters per second in draft mode, four- 
color dot-matrix printer. IBM developed the real time, 
multitasking Computer System Operating System (CSOS) . 
The price varied from $5,695 to over $10,000 depending 
on the configuration. 

The PC Series 

In February 1982, three projects were initiated 
that would become the PC AT, PC Junior (PCjr) and the 
PC/XT. The PCjr was targeted at the low end of the 
market for home consumers. The PC/XT, with the XT 
representing extended technology, had a hard disk and 
was targeted at the professional business market above 
the PC. The PC AT, with the AT representing Advanced 
Technology would feature the new Intel 8028 6 
microprocessor. IBM assigned the code name of Circus to 
the PC AT project. 

The Corporate Management Committee (CMC) in 
Armonk approved all three projects. Product managers for 
each of the projects were selected to administer the 
development of the products . 


9/12 Part III 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 


Personal Computer XT (PC/XT) 

The product manager selected to develop the PC/XT 
was Joseph Sarubbi. The PC/XT would be the only project 
of the three approved in February 1982 to stay on 
schedule and be released on time. 

IBM introduced the PC/XT model in March 1983 in 
New York City. It included hard disk drive technology 
but utilized the same microprocessor as the PC. This new 
model was evolutionary. There had been expectations that 
IBM would utilize either the Intel 8086 or 80186 
microprocessors. However once again IBM had taken a 
conservative approach to implementation of new 
technology. 

The following are some details of the model. The 
microprocessor was the Intel 8088, the same as the IBM 
PC computer. Standard memory was 12 8K, expandable to 
256K on the mother board and to 640K by adding expansion 
cards. The 40K of ROM contained the Microsoft Basic 
interpreter and Basic Input Output System (BIOS) 
software . 

A 10 megabyte Winchester hard-disk drive 
manufactured by Seagate was the significant feature of 
the standard unit. Also included was a single 5 1/4 inch 
floppy disk drive, utilizing 360K byte double-sided, 
double-density disks. An asynchronous communications 
adapter was standard. The motherboard had eight 
expansion slots, as compared to five on the PC computer. 
However three slots were used by the communications 
adapter, floppy disk drive and hard disk drive adapters. 
The audio cassette recorder connector that had been on 
the PC was deleted. IBM also released its first RGB 
color monitor for both the PC and XT computers. 

The cost of the standard unit with 128K of RAM, 
keyboard, 10 megabyte hard disk drive, 360K floppy disk 
drive and a asynchronous communications adapter card was 
$4,995. A monochrome adapter and display was $680. A 
color graphics adapter and color display monitor was 
$924. The PC XT model was a huge success and became a 
workhorse of the business world. 

Microsoft made improvements to the operating 
system software for the PC/XT release. In addition to 


The IBM Corporation 9/13 

support for the Winchester hard disk, new features such 
as a hierarchical file system with sub directories were 
incorporated into version 2.00 of the operating system. 
An updated version 2.00 of BASIC was also released that 
provided advanced support for communications, graphics 
and music. The generic name of this BASIC interpreter 
was GWBASIC (Gee Whiz BASIC). The PC-DOS 2.00 operating 
system and BASIC 2.00 interpreter cost $60 each. 

PC Junior (PCjr) 

The product manager selected to develop the PC 
Junior in February 1982 was Bill Sydnes . Sydnes wanted 
to develop a product for the consumer market that would 
be sold by mass merchandisers to compete with the Apple 
II computer at a lower price. Although it would have a 
somewhat limited capability compared to the PC, its 
performance capabilities could be improved by the 
purchase of upgrade features. The code name "Peanut" 
became associated with the new product. IBM contracted 
the manufacture of the computer to Teledyne Inc., in 
Tennessee, a company founded by Arthur Rock and Henry 
Singleton . 

In the summer of 1983, Sydnes resigned from IBM 
due to differences of opinion with Don Estridge on 
marketing and other aspects of the PC Junior 
development. He then joined the Franklin Computer 
Corporation as vice president for product development. 
The new manager would be Dave O'Connor. However, 
O'Connor had inherited design and production problems 
that delayed the release date from that initially 
targeted. 

The PC Junior (PCjr) was introduced in November 
1983 with high expectations as a low-priced home 
computer. However customer deliveries of the computer 
did not occur until early 1984. The PCjr had three 
separate pieces of hardware: the system unit, power 
transformer and cordless keyboard. Two configurations of 
the PCjr were released, a standard model and an enhanced 
model. Both models used the Intel 8088 microprocessor 
operating at 4.77 MHz with 64K bytes of ROM. The system 
unit had three expansion slots for 64K bytes of 
additional memory, a floppy disk drive and a 300-bps 


9/14 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

(bits per second) internal modem. An expansion bus 
connector was also provided that could be used to 
connect a parallel printer. The detached keyboard had 62 
keys and used an optical infrared light transmission 
technology to link between the keyboard and the system 
unit. The keyboard did not have a numeric key pad or any 
function keys . 

The standard model had 64K bytes of RAM, 
expandable to 128K and a base price of $669. The 
enhanced model had 12 8K bytes of RAM, a capacity to 
display 80 columns of text and a half-height 5.25-inch, 
360K byte double-sided floppy disk drive manufactured by 
Qume . The enhanced model had a price of $1,269. An IBM 
Color Display monitor was available at a price of $680. 

A new version 2.1 of PC-DOS with a cost of $65 
was released for the PCjr. However the memory 
requirements of the operating system limited the number 
of application programs that would run on the computer. 
The system was compatible with the IBM Personal Computer 
(IBM PC) . No other operating systems were offered for 
the PCjr. The standard model had Cassette BASIC in ROM 
and an enhanced Cartridge BASIC was available for $75. 

In early 1984 sales for the PC Junior were in 
trouble and production was stopped in June to reduce 
inventory. The high price, spongy-to-touch "chiclet" 
style keyboard, limited memory and storage capabilities 
had resulted in poor customer acceptance. 

An advanced version of the PC Junior was 
introduced in July 198 4. Various improvements to enhance 
the performance were made, such as increased memory and 
a new typewriter-style keyboard. Then an intensive 
promotional campaign was launched in the late fall of 
1984 to increase lagging sales. However after the 
holiday season and the end of the promotional campaign 
sales fell off again. It had been a market failure that 
resulted in the computer being discontinued in March 
1985. 


The IBM Corporation 9/15 

PC/XT 370 and 32 70 PC 

The Information Systems Division that produced 
mainframe computers, introduced the PC/XT 370 and 3270 
PC computers in October 1983. These products were 
designed to be a link to IBM mainframe computer systems. 

The PC/XT 370 also had a designation of 5160 
Model 588. This computer was an enhancement of the PC/XT 
computer, with three additional boards to emulate IBM 
System/370 mainframe computers and to function as an IBM 
3277 display terminal. In addition to the standard PC/XT 
Intel 8088 microprocessor, one of the additional boards 
had three microprocessors. One of the three 
microprocessors was an Intel 8087 for floating-point 
arithmetic functions and the other two microprocessors 
were based on the Motorola MC68000 for emulation of 
System/370 instructions. The second additional board 
extended memory by 512K to 768K bytes. The third board 
provided emulation of the IBM 32 77 display terminal. The 
computer also had one 3 60K byte floppy disk drive and 
either a 10 or 20 megabyte hard disk drive. The PC/XT 
370 cost $8,995 with a 10 MB hard disk and $11,690 with 
a 2 MB hard disk. A software package named VM/PC 
(Virtual Machine/Personal Computer) was reguired at a 
cost of $1,000 to interface with a System/370. 

The IBM 3270 Personal Computer also had a 
designation of 5371 with Models 12, 14 and 16 depending 
on the configuration. The computer combined a standard 
IBM Personal Computer with an IBM 3270 display terminal. 
The base computer had 256K bytes of memory, expandable 
to 640K and a 122-key keyboard with all the keys of a 
standard PC and a 3270 terminal. A 3270 PC Control 
Program enabled the computer to concurrently access up 
to four programs on a host computer, two "notebook" 
data-storage transfer areas and a PC-DOS application 
program. The Control Program also allowed a user to 
define up to seven windows to monitor the programs being 
accessed. The user could select the color, position and 
size of any window. A base 3270 Personal Computer with 
256K bytes of memory cost $4,130 and the 3270 PC Control 
Program $300. 


9/16 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

Portable PC 

The Portable Personal Computer (PC) was 
introduced in February 198 4. The unit measured 8 by 2 
by 17 inches and weighed 30 pounds. With this weight, it 
would become known as a "luggable." The portable used an 
Intel 8088 microprocessor operating at 4.77 MHz, 40K 
bytes of ROM and 256K bytes of RAM, expandable to 640K. 
The unit had one 5.25 inch half-height 360K floppy disk 
drive with provision for a second drive. A 9 inch amber 
monitor was built into the unit, seven expansion slots 
were provided (two used by the floppy disk drive and 
monitor adapter) and the cost was $2,595. However Compag 
had an earlier and better portable which sold at 
virtually the same price which adversely affected IBM 
sales and market acceptance. 

Personal Computer A T (PC A T) 

Two models of the PC AT (Advanced Technology) 
were introduced in August 198 4. This was a significant 
delay from the release date targeted in February 1982 . 
The variations were a Base model with less memory and no 
hard disk drive and an Enhanced model. 

The microprocessor was the more powerful 16/24- 
bit Intel 8 0286 operating at 6 MHz with an optional 
Intel 80287 Math coprocessor. The permanent memory (ROM) 
was 64K. The user memory (RAM) was 256K bytes on the 
Base model and 512K bytes on the Enhanced model. With 
additional expansion cards, the memory could be expanded 
to three megabytes on both models . 

Both models had one half-height 1.2 megabyte 
floppy disk drive with provision for a second drive. The 
Enhanced model had a 20 megabyte hard disk drive. Hard 
disk drives with up to 40 megabytes capacity could be 
installed in both models. The models contained eight 
expansion slots for additional adapter cards . The 
keyboard was an enhanced version of the PC keyboard. 
Microsoft released Version 3.00 of PC-DOS and XENIX 28 6 
operating systems for the new models. 

The Base model cost $3,995 and the Enhanced model 
$5,795. The computers were intended as replacements for 
the XT computer. IBM stated that the computer was 
designed to be a multitask, multi-user computer. 


The IBM Corporation 9/17 

Problems with the hard disk drive resulted in delayed 
deliveries of the computer. However the AT computer had 
good reviews and became a up-market replacement for the 
XT. The operating speed of the PC AT microprocessor was 
increased to 8 MHz in 198 6. 

PCRT 

IBM approved development of a workstation 
computer using the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set 
Computing) ROMP (Research Office products 
Microprocessor) processor in 1983. G. Glenn Henry was 
the manager of hardware and software system development. 
The project had the code name of Olympiad and became the 
PC RT computer. 

The PC RT workstation was introduced for work 
such as CAD (Computer Assisted Design) in January 198 6. 
It utilized a high performance (approximately 2 million 
instructions per second) IBM ROMP 32-bit RISC processor. 
An Intel 80286 microprocessor was used as a coprocessor 
to facilitate program and user interface with the PC 
family of computers . A Memory Management Unit (MMU) 
extended the 32 bit processor address to a 40 bit 
virtual address to provide advanced virtual storage 
capabilities. The computer had one megabyte of memory, a 
1.2 megabyte floppy disk drive and a 40 megabyte hard 
disk drive. It utilized an AIX (Advanced Interactive 
Executive) operating system based on AT&T's UNIX System 
V operating system. The PC RT workstation cost $11,700. 

The workstation was not received well due to poor 
performance as compared to competitive products from 
Apollo and Sun Microsystems . This resulted in a new 
project with the code name of RIOS being started in 1986 
to develop a new more powerful workstation that would 
become the RISC System/6000. 

PC Convertible 

IBM introduced the 5140 PC Convertible (code- 
named Clamshell) laptop computer in April 198 6. The 
computer name was selected because it could be used as a 
portable or as a desktop with an expansion box and a 
larger monitor. The unit weighed 12 pounds and featured 
an Intel 8088 microprocessor, 256K bytes of memory, two 


9/18 Part III 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 

3.5 inch 720K byte floppy disk drives and a 25-line 
liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. The computer cost 
$2,995. However, the product was not successful due to 
the use of an older processor, problems with the LCD 
display and the early use of 3.5 inch floppy disk 
drives . 

PC/XT Model 286 

The PC/XT Model 286 was introduced in September 
1986. It featured the Intel 80286 microprocessor, 640K 
bytes of memory, one 1.2 MB floppy disk drive, a 2 
megabyte hard disk drive and cost $3,995. However the 
late introduction and pricing relative to other 
competitive products resulted in poor sales. 

PS/2 Series 

The Personal System/2 (PS/2) family of personal 
computers was introduced in April 1987 (except the Model 
25) . The "2" in the PS/2 product name, denoted a second 
generation of personal systems. The Models 50, 60 and 80 
had a new architecture with a proprietary Micro Channel 
Architecture (MCA) bus. MCA was a 32-bit multitasking 
bus that did not support the previous expansion cards 
for the PC computer. IBM's intent was to regain control 
of the open architecture and force clone manufacturers 
to obtain a MCA license. The preceding models also 
utilized a new video standard called VGA (Video Graphics 
Array) that had improved screen resolution. The new OS/2 
operating system developed by IBM and Microsoft was also 
announced for use with the computers. 

The following are some details of the various 
PS/2 models introduced in April. The Model 30 was 
available in two configurations and featured an Intel 
8086 microprocessor operating at 8 MHz, 640K bytes of 
memory and the PC XT bus. The Model 30-002 had two 720K 
byte floppy disk drives and cost $1,695. The Model 30- 
021 had one 720K byte floppy disk drive, a 20 megabyte 
hard disk and cost $2,295. The Model 50 had an Intel 
80286 microprocessor, one megabyte of memory, 1.44 
megabyte floppy disk drive, 20 megabyte hard disk drive 
and cost $3,595. The Model 60 featured an Intel 80286 
microprocessor, one megabyte of memory, 1.44 megabyte 


The IBM Corporation 9/19 

floppy disk drive, 44 megabyte hard disk drive and cost 
$5,295. The Model 80 was available in three 
configurations using the Intel 8038 6 microprocessor and 
a 1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive. The Model 80-041 had 
one megabyte of memory, a 44 megabyte hard disk drive 
and cost $6,995. The Model 80-071 had two megabytes of 
memory, a 70 megabyte hard disk drive and cost $8,495. 
The Model 80-111 had two megabytes of memory, a 115 
megabyte hard disk drive and cost $10,995. 

The Model 25 was a low cost computer, introduced 
for business and educational users in August 1987. It 
featured the Intel 8086 microprocessor, 640K bytes of 
memory, a 720K byte floppy disk drive and cost $1,395. 

A portable version of the PS/2 series, the PS/2 
P70 was announced in May 1989. At a weight of 20.8 
pounds it would now be called a "luggable." It used an 
Intel 80386 processor, had 4 MB of RAM (expandable to 8 
MB) , 120 MB of disk storage, MCA bus and a high- 
resolution plasma display. The PS/2 P70 received good 
reviews and had good sales. 

The PS/2 series of computers were not well 
received in the marketplace. IBM had focused on the 
older Intel 80286 microprocessor rather than the latest 
80386 chip. Also the incompatibility of the new MCA bus 
with old add-on cards, the late release of the new 
version and general poor acceptance of the OS/2 
operating system, all contributed to sales below 
expectations. The MCA bus was not supported by the 
industry and became a strategic mistake for IBM. 


9.5 ... Software 


OS/2 and Microsoft 

By the end of 198 4, Bob Markell who was a vice 
president of software and communication products at IBM, 
had created a task force to determine a suitable 
operating system for future products. IBM had been 
working on its own operating system called CP-DOS that 
would be used for the 286 microprocessor initially and 
the 386 microprocessor later. IBM also wanted a system 
that incorporated multitasking, so a user could run more 


9/20 Part III 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 

than one application at the same time. Company 
management had mixed aspirations to develop the new 
operating system internally independent of Microsoft. 
However, discussions were held with Microsoft regarding 
the new system that culminated in the signing of a joint 
development agreement in June 1985. 

The joint development efforts following the 
agreement led to numerous difficulties between the two 
different types of corporate styles . IBM was attempting 
to satisfy many different corporate demands and were 
adding an increasing number of personnel to the project 
to maintain the completion schedule. Microsoft was 
accustomed to software development with a small group of 
talented programmers. However, Microsoft had conceded 
final responsibility for the software design to IBM. 

Another significant decision that would create 
subseguent difficulties was the use of assembler 
language to program the new operating system. This 
choice and a focus on the Intel 8028 6 microprocessor for 
the PS/2 series of computers would add to the complexity 
and portability of the new system. 

In mid 198 6 a new concept called Systems 
Application Architecture (SAA) was approved for 
implementation. This system provided a common software 
development environment between the different IBM 
hardware levels, from personal computers to mainframes. 
However it also resulted in additional complexity to the 
software. Also, a new graphical user interface that 
would be called Presentation Manager, would be developed 
by the graphics software group in Hursley, England. 

The company was also now working on an Extended 
Edition of the new operating system that Microsoft was 
excluded from participating in. The Extended Edition 
included communications and database services. IBM also 
planned to introduce a set of office applications that 
would be called OfficeVision for the Extended Edition. 

During this period new personal computer hardware 
was also being developed. The new hardware would have a 
different bus concept called Micro Channel Architecture 
(MCA) and an Advanced Basic Input/Output System (ABIOS) . 
With strong enforcement of applicable patents this was 
going to be IBM' s strategy to combat the clones . 


The IBM Corporation 9/21 

IBM announced the new operating system called 
OS/2 with the Personal System/2 computers in April 1987. 
A Standard and Extended Version 1.0 were released in 
November. However it did not include the Presentation 
Manager software that was now promised for October 1988. 
Only a few application programs were available. The 
program cost $325 (twice as much as DOS), reguired 
additional memory and storage as compared to DOS, and 
was not well received. 

In May 1988, IBM joined the Open Software 
Foundation (OSF) that was established to develop a 
unified UNIX operating system for different platforms . 
Then IBM purchased a license for the NeXTSTEP operating 
system from NeXT Computer, Inc. IBM was intent on 
establishing optional operating systems to OS/2 and PC- 
DOS . 

IBM released Presentation Manager as part of OS/2 
Version 1.1 in October 1988. The graphical user 
interface had been developed by IBM in Boca Raton, 
Florida, IBM laboratories in Hursley, England and by 
Microsoft. The graphics were well received. However, the 
lack of application programs and device drivers, the 
reguirement for additional memory and the pricing 
adversely affected sales. 

During 1989, James A. Cannavino, the new head of 
the Entry Systems Division began to guestion the 
viability of OS/2 and the relationship between IBM and 
Microsoft. His concerns related to the low acceptance of 
OS/2, the income Microsoft derived from the PC disk 
operating system software and the potential impact of a 
new version of Windows being developed by Microsoft. 
Software vendors were also expressing concerns regarding 
the future market share of OS/2 and their significant 
investments in application programs for the new 
operating system. Cannavino had even recommended that 
IBM drop OS/2 in March. However, corporate management 
rejected his recommendation and instructed him to "build 
a world class operating system. " Cannavino had 
discussions with Bill Gates and a tenuous agreement was 
announced at the fall COMDEX show that appeared to 
support each companies system. However Cannavino had 
been committed to OS/2, not Microsoft Windows. In late 


9/22 Part III 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 

1989, Version 1.2 of OS/2 was released, however sales of 
the OS/2 operating system were still well below 
expectations . 

Other Software 

Displaywrite was a word processor developed by 
IBM for the DisplayWriter workstation in 1980. It was 
one of the few relatively successful application 
programs written by IBM. 

TopView was an IBM character-based user interface 
that was announced in August 1984. It incorporated 
windows and multitasking that enabled the running of 
multiple programs with the ability to switch between 
them. It was not released until January 1985 and cost 
$149. However, it was slow, reguired a lot of memory and 
did not have a graphical interface. Due to poor 
acceptance it was withdrawn from the market in June 
1987. 

IBM released PC Network in conjunction with 
Microsoft PC-DOS Version 3.1 in March 1985. It was 
designed to connect the PC-family of computers in a 
local-area network (LAN) . 

A software group was formed by Joseph M. 
Guglielmi in 1987 to develop an office system that would 
facilitate the communication and sharing of information 
and software such as databases, desktop publishing, 
electronic mail, spreadsheets and word processors. The 
application software used the name OfficeVision for its 
products. David Liddle who had worked at Xerox PARC, was 
a principal in the development of the OfficeVision suite 
of software released in June 1989. However, it was not 
graphically oriented, priced too high and was not 
successful. IBM essentially disbanded the software group 
around 1992. 

IBM created a Desktop Software division in 1988. 
It was established to market personal computer software 
by IBM and other companies using the IBM logo. However 
it was not successful either and was terminated around 
1992. 


The IBM Corporation 9/23 
9.6 ... Corporate Activities 

1980 and 1981 are significant years due to the 
approval and release of the IBM Personal Computer (see 
Sections 9.2 and 9.3) . John Opel became the chief 
executive officer of IBM in January 1981. 

In January 1982, the Department of Justice 
withdrew its antitrust suit against IBM. In late 1982, 
an executive search firm for Apple Computer contacted 
Don Estridge as a potential candidate for the position 
of president. However Estridge declined the offer. 

Then in December 1982 IBM acguired 12 percent of 
Intel Corporation stock for $250 million. Intel was 
having financial problems due in part to Japanese 
competition in memory chips. IBM made the stock purchase 
to provide a secure source for its microprocessors and 
to maintain the viability of domestic chip manufacturing 
eguipment suppliers. This also resulted in Intel 
licensing the manufacture of the chip to others. IBM now 
had a second source for its microprocessors. IBM also 
built a new highly automated factory to mass produce the 
PC computers. 

John Opel became chairman of the board and John 
F. Akers president of IBM in February 1983. In August, 
the Personal Computer unit at Boca Raton, Florida became 
part of a new Entry Systems Division (ESD) and Don 
Estridge was appointed president of the division. The 
new divisional organization consolidated major 
facilities at Boca Raton and Austin, Texas . It also had 
worldwide responsibilities for product development and 
management including plants in Greenock, Scotland and 
Wangaratta, Australia. Joe Bauman became vice president 
for manufacturing, Joseph Sarubbi director of 
technologies and Dan Wilkie director of guality 
assurance and technology for the new division. 

Starting in 1983, the company began implementing 
the traditional bureaucracy at the Entry Systems 
Division. The freedom enjoyed by the original IBM PC 
group was coming to an end. H. L. Sparks and James 
D'Arezzo left IBM and joined Compag Computer Corporation 
in 1983. Then in January 1984, Estridge was made a vice 
president of IBM. 


9/24 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

Responsibility for retail dealer sales of all PC 
products was moved from the Entry Systems Division to 
the corporate national sales organization in January 
1985. John Akers became the chief executive officer in 
February. In March, Estridge was promoted to vice 
president of worldwide manufacturing for IBM and William 
Lowe became president of the Entry Systems Division. 
Then in a tragic plane crash, Don Estridge was killed at 
the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas airport in August. In late 
1985, Dan Wilkie resigned from IBM to become president 
of another company. 

Joe Sarubbi retired from IBM and joined the 
Tandon Corporation as a senior vice president of 
manufacturing in February 198 6. In the spring of 198 6, 
the number of IBM employees peaked at 407,000. During 
198 6, IBM concluded a technological exchange agreement 
with the Intel Corporation (See Section 8.4) . In June 
John Akers became chairman of the board, a year that saw 
significant reductions in IBM's financial performance. 

In 1987, it appeared that the financial 
difficulties encountered in 198 6 would continue. Akers 
initiated the formation of task forces to evaluate the 
problem. This resulted in the closure of a parts 
distribution facility and a reduction of 10,000 
employees by early retirement and severance package 
options. IBM also sold the remaining shares of Intel 
Corporation stock that the company purchased in 1982. 

Akers announced a further reorganization to 
delegate more decision making down to lower levels in 
the company organization in January 1988. Then in 
December William Lowe left IBM and joined the Xerox 
Corporation. He was replaced by James Cannavino who 
inherited an extremely difficult business situation in 
the Personal Computer group. The group had lost 1.4 
billion dollars in 1998, the PS/2 computer was not 
selling, the MCA bus and the OS/2 operating system were 
not accepted by either customers or the industry. 

In March 1989, Cannavino made a number of 
recommendations to the IBM Board to correct the business 
situation of the PC group. Some of these recommendations 
were: to significantly reduce the company's focus on the 
desktop business, increase their participation in the 


The IBM Corporation 9/25 

portable and server segment of the business and drop the 
OS/2 operating system. However, the Board wanted to keep 
IBM in the PC business, retain the OS/2 operating system 
and review the relationship with Microsoft. Cannavino 
was also concerned about reducing IBM' s dealer and sales 
organization costs, and competition from direct sellers 
such as Dell and Gateway. 

In May, Jack D. Kuehler became the president of 
IBM and Cannavino was promoted to general manager of the 
Personal Computer group in mid 1989. Around this time 
Cannavino selected Bob Lawten to analyze IBM' s efforts 
in the portable computer segment of the market. After 
discussions and agreement with Bill Gates at Microsoft, 
Cannavino made a recommendation that IBM purchase forty 
percent of Microsoft. This would motivate both companies 
to make the relationship work. However, this proposal 
was rejected by the IBM Board. The reorganization and 
changes implemented by Cannavino during 1989, resulted 
in a change from a loss of 1.4 billion dollars in 1988 
to a profit of 1.2 billion dollars in 1989.

The new PARC human interface concepts

initiatives of Wozniak. The development of the Lisa 
computer and the Macintosh computer that would be the 
future of Apple in the 1930's. 

10.1 ... Corporate & Other Activities 

Public Stock Offering 

The initial founders Jobs, Wozniak, Markkula, Holt 
and the venture capitalists who provided the financing 
had a tight control of the Apple Computer shares. 
Markkula also kept a firm control on the later sale and 
award of Apple shares. Initial shares went through 
several splits that significantly increased their value. 
A share distributed before April 1979 was the equivalent 
of t j".i rty-tw-:- shares on the day that Apple went public. 

During 1980 the market for new stock issues had 
improved. In August 1980 the Apple Computer board of 
directors decided to make a public offering of shares in 
the company. Apple selected two firms who offered 4.6 
million shares of common stock for sale in December 
1980. It was a huge success and oversubscribed. On the 
first day the offered share price of 522 increased to 
529. At the end of December 1980 Jobs' ownership in the 


10/2 Part III 1980's -- The IBM /Macintosh era 

company was worth about $256 million, Markkula's $239 
million, Wozniak's $136 million and Holt's $67 million. 

1980/82 Activities 

The company introduced Apple FORTRAN in January 

1980, then they announced the Apple III computer in May 
(see Section 10.2). In August at a company board meeting 
the board members decided to implement a new company 

functional one to a product-oriented one. The company 

created Divisions for the Apple II and Apple III, Lisa, 

In February 1981 Wozniak crashed his airplane on 

take-off from a local airport. Wozniak had serious 
injuries and for a period of time suffered from amnesia 
and lapses of conscious-ess. By early 1b81 the employee 
count had grown rapidly to nearly 2,000. An adjustment 
required just over 40 employees being terminated in 
February. The Terminations, and the way Mirie Scott 
handled them, had a bad effect on employee morale. 
Employees described the layoff as "Black Wednesday." A 
number of activities were converging to undermine the 
effectiveness of Apple's president Mike Scott. He was 
experiencing potentially serious health problems with an 
eye infection. Also he had not impressed management with 
the poorly handled layoffs. After an executive meeting 
in March, Markkula requested Scott's resignation and 
assumed the presidency of the company. 

With release of the IBM PC computer in August 

1981, Apple made an interesting competitive response. 
Adve _t isement s in a number of national newspaper 
published an open letter to IBM. It stated "Welcome, 
IBM. Seriously. Welcome to the most exciting and 
important marketplace . . ." Jobs received a personal 
reply from John Opel, the president of IBM thanking him 

Jobs appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 
February 1982 with the caption "Striking it Rich — 
America's Risk Takers." Lire magazine also featured him 
a month later. Jobs appeared again in the January 1983 


Apple Computer in the 19B0's 10/3 

computer as the "Machine of the Year." The article was 
not complimentary of Jobs, but he was becoming a 
national personality. 

In May 1982, Apple sued Franklin Computer 
Corporation for patent and copyright infringement. 
Wozniak, who had been playing a less significant role 
within the company, decided to return to college and 
complete his bachelor's degree. Wozniak also arranged 
and financed a "US Festival" of rock music in September 
and a second one in 1983. It was during 1982 that Apple, 
at Jobs' initiative, began the process of giving Apple 
computers to academic institutions and prisons. In 
November 19 82 Apple held its first Apple Fes t in San 
Francisco, California. Then in December, Apple became 
the first personal computer company to reach a rate of 
one billion dollars in annual sales. 

The company started a project in 1982 called the 
Apple IIx using an early version of the Western Design 
Center 55815 microprocessor. The engineering manager was 
Dan Hillman with some assistance from Wozniak in 1983. 
However availability and reliability problems with the 

other Apple products resulted in the project

John Sculley had a bachelor's degree from Brown 
University and an MBA from the University of 
Pennsylvania Wharton School. Sculley joined Pepsi-Cola 
in 1967 and became president of the company in 1977. 
Markkula offered Sculley $1 million to join Apple, $1 
million in annual pay and options for 350,000 shares of 
Apple stock in the spring of 1983. In addition he 

and SI million in severance if he did not work out. 
Within a few months the stock options would be worth 
over 9 million dollars. Jobs had made a pointed comment 
to Sculley when he said "Do you want to spend the rest 
of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a 
chance to change the world?" Sculley accepted the offer 


Apple Computer in the 1980's 


Oilier Activities between 19S3 and 19S9 

The company announced the Apple lie and Lisa 
computers in January 1983 (see Sections 10.3 and 10.4 
respectively). The publicity described the computers as 
"evolution and revolution." Bill Atkinson and Rich Page 
became Apple Fellows in February. Then Apple Computer 
entered The Fortur.e "'.agazine top 500 companies at jvumoa:/ 
411 in May and built the one millionth Apple II in June. 
It was the first computer awarded in a program called 
"Kids Can't Kait," That provided computers to about 
9,000 schools in California. Apple introduced the ProDOS 
operating system in June and an integrated software 
package oalleo Apple 1 /?:' _" !::;: i- Novembe i" . The company then 
introduced the Apple III Plus computer and the 
ImageWriter dot-matrix printer in December. Apple sales 
had surpassed one billion dollars annual rate by 
December. However competition from companies such as IBM 
had reduced profits. An industry wide recession had 
started that resulted in significant staff reductions. 
Sculley then decided to reorganize the company into two 
operational groups; the Apple II and Apple 32 that 
integrated the Lisa and Maci-tosr. product lines. 

The company announced the Lisa 2 (see Section 
10.4) and the Macintosh (see Section 10.5) computers in 
January 1984 . The company also released the ProDOS 
operating system f ■: i' Apoie II coraoutr i" s a:\o is ached a:\ 
out-of-court settlement of their patent infringement 
suit with Franklin Computer Corporation in January. Then 
Apple introduced the Apple lie computer (see Section 
10.3) and discontinued development of the Apple III 
product line in April. Alan Kay who had been a principal 
at Xerox PARC and chief scientist at Atari, became an 
Apple Fellow in May. Apple introduced the DuoDisk for 
the Apple II computer in June for $795, that was 
essentially two 5.25-inch Disk II drives in a single 

Apple Writer 2 . was released in September. During the 

year the company investigated strategic alliances with 

companies such as AT&T, General Electric, General Motors 


10/« Part III 1980's -- The IBM /Macintosh era 

to increase company penetration in the office systems 
market. Sales boomed until September, and by November 
Apple had sold two millicn .Apple II compute r s . Howeveu 
during the last three months of 19B4 an industry wide 
recession lowered Apple II, Lisa and Macintosh sales 
significantly below marketing forecasts. 

In 1984, Andy Hertzfeld who had worked on the 
development of software for the Macintosh computer, left 
Apple Computer and cieve lopec. a program called Swiccher. 
The program was developed to compete with integrated 

applications that could be running simultaneously. 
Hertzfeld sold the program to Apple Computer who 

supplied it free with the Macintosh computer. 

Apple introduced the Macintosh Office software and 

56,999 in January 1985. The printer used a Motorola 
MC68020 microprocessor and the Adobe PostScript page 
description language (PDL) . The Macintosh Office 
featured the AppleTalk Personal Network software that 
allowed a group of Macintosh computers to communicate 
and be connected to a LaserWriter printer. Unfortunately 
some key elements of the Macintosh Office software such 
as the File Server for sharing information were not 
ready. Wozniak left Apple in February and started a new 
company called CL-9 (Cloud-Nine) to develop remote 
control products for the home . Apple enhanced the Apple 
lie computers in March and terminate-:; production of the 
Lisa computer in April. Different versions of a 3.5-inch 
UniDisk drive with a capacity of 800K bytes were 
released in 1985 for the Apple II computers. 

As sales deteriorated, the relationship between 
Jobs and Sculley also deteriorated. In the spring of 
1985 they contested in a somewhat acrimonious manner for 
the leadership of the company. This executive 

Sculley as CEO of the company to make organizational 
changes. After securing the support of the board members 
in April, he persuaded them to relieve Jobs of any 
operational role in the company. In May the product 


Apple Computer in the 1980's 10/7 

and Sculley adjusted in 1983, changed back to a 
functional one. Personnel changes included: Del Yocam, 

Jean-Louise Gassee, would be in charge of product 
development; Deborah A. Coleman, world-wide 

manufacturing; and Michael H. Spindler, all 

three manufacturing plants and laid off 1,200 employees. 
Finally Apple declared its first quarterly loss. 

Another problem f-:-r Asple Computet: was a Lack ■:■ f 
application software for the Macintosh computer. This 
resulted in a campaign to encourage software companies 
to develop application programs for the Macintosh. Guy 
Kawasaki who had joined Apple in 1983 and Mike Eoich 
became "software evangelists," that promoted the new 
campaign. A significant application program for the 
Macintosh, would be the desktop publishing program 
called PageMaker . 

Jobs resigned in September and started a new 
company called NeXT Computer, Inc. However when five key 
personnel joined NeXT, Apple started litigation to stop 
Jobs and NeXT Computer from using any of its proprietary 
technology. 

Work was started in 1984 to develop an online 
worldwide network to support the company's dealers. This 
evolved into a Macintosh system called AppleLink that 
went online in July 1985. The system was maintained and 
operated as a joint effort between Apple Computer and 
General Electric. It featured easy-to-use graphics, 

LaserWriter Plus in January 1986. Sculley became 
chairman of the company and Apple reached an out-of- 
court settlement in the litigation with Steve Jobs in 
January. By February, Jobs had sold his holdings of 

Markkula now became the largest shareholder. Wozniak 
graduated from the University of California at Berkeley 
in June. The company announced the Apple IIGS computer 
and the enhanced Apple lie in September (see Section 
10.3) . 


10/8 Part III 1980's -- The IBM /Macintosh era 

Apple introduced the Macintosh SE and Macintosh II 

(see Section 10.5) in March 1987. Then in April, the 

company decided ;i ctest? an ir.dep^Vjde:". t v,\".olly cvnecl 
subsidiary called the Claris Corporation, to take over 
sales Fi-d marketing of Apple application software. Apple 
also introduced the MultiFinder operating system 
software and the HyperCard software for the Macintosh 
computer at the Macworld trade show in Boston in August. 

After helping to create the latest versions of the 
Macintosh computer, Steve Sakoman became head of a new 
research project in 1987 . Sakoman wanted to create a 
radically different personal information device he named 
Newton. It would be oen-oaseo , u = e hanclwi" it i-g 

prototype slatelike device had been developed that 
measured 8.5 by 11 inches. However, the estimated cost 

had grown from an early target of 52, 500 to between 
56, 000 and 58, 000 and Sakoman was having problems with 
corporate support. 

Bill Atkinson developed the HyperCard system 
software and the HyperTalk programming language in 
August 1987. This personal software toolkit provided a 
capability to organize a body of information and then 

could be text, graphics, video, animation or sound. 

In March 1988, Apple started litigation against 
Microsoft. Apple claimed for infringement of the 
Macintosh graphics in a new release of MS Windows 
Version 2.0 3 software. The suit also named Hewlett- 
Packard and it's NewWave software in the litigation. 
Apple introduced the Apple lie Plus and the Macintosh 
IIx (see Section 10.5) computers in September. The 
Macintosh IIx was the first Apple computer to use the 
Motorola MC68030 microprocessor and 68882 math 
coprocessor. Claris released AppleWorks GS for the Apple 
IIGS computer in October. 

In July 1989 a judgment in the litigation with 
Microsoft, significantly reduced Apple Computer's 

claims . Apple announced the Macintosh Portable and the 
Macintosh Ilci in September 1989 (see Section 10.5). The 
Macintosh Ilci was a high performance version of the 
Macintosh Ilex. In 1989 Xerox filed a lawsuit against 


Apple Computer in the 1980's 10/9 

Apple, stating it had infringed on the PARC copyrights . 

1990 . 

Following the company reorganization in 1985 and 
the introduction of Macintosh products with more memory 
and hard disk storage, the fiscal condition at Apple 
started to improve. Although corporate management 
problems continued. Areas such as executive direction 
and software development oould have been improve-:;. A 
tug-of-war between profit margin and an open or licensed 
product architecture to increase the Macintosh market 

reaching effects. These years were a turning point for 
the company. The open architecture of the IBM Personal 
Computer and all its clones, resulted in a massive 
market support in both hardware and software development 
that would be detrimental to Apple's future leadership 
in the industry. However, sales and profits continued to

5.3 billion dollars and the total number of employees 
14,517. An impressive growth compared to 1979. John 
Sculley as chairman, president and chief executive 
officer had made significant achievements since his 
arrival in 1983. However the past was history, as he

10.2 ... Apple III 


_he Apple __I com;: .:te _" hex', a ::li f f ioult gestation 
from its start in 1978 as the Sara project. A 
requirement to be able to run Apple II software, limited 
the microprocessor selection and created difficulties 
with the design. Wendell Sander was the chief hardware 
designer. Jobs was involved initially with the product 
design and affected i~ r - oomplet ion ocheorule wi~h 
numerous demands. Apple set a constricted target date 
and problems developed around the time Jobs got 
interested in the Lisa technology. Planning required 
Apple III development within ten months. It was to be a

off in Apple II sales and the introduction of Lisa. The 
company targeted the Apple III at the small business 

owner and for professional-managerial users. Apple 
announced the computer at the National Computer 
Conference in Anaheim, California in May 1980 and 
started shipping them in the fall of 1980.

The computer used a Synertek 6502A microprocessor 

with 96K bytes of memory, expandable to 128K. The unit 
included one built-in 5. 2 5- inch, 143K byte floppy-disk 
drive and the terminal could display 2 4 lines of 8 0- 
column text.

The company released a 5 megabyte hard disk called 
ProFile for use with the system in September 1981. The 

incorporated had a detrimental effect on the quality of 
the computer. A number of problems required a redesign 
of the computer then re-introduction in December. Apple 
allowed early customers to exchange their old computer 
for a new one . The company introduced the Apple III Plus 
with 25eK bytes cf memory, other improvement =j a^\6. a 
price of 52, 995 in December 1983 . However after the 
introduction of the Macintosh and Lisa 2, the company 
discontinued the product line in April 1984. The initial 
poor quality resulted in only sixty-five thousand Apple 
Ill's being sold in the three years after its 
introduction. The resources committed to the release and 
problems with the Apple III during 1980/81, inhibited 
enhancements to the Apple II product line. 

10.3... Apple IPs 

Apple lie 

During 1981 the Apple II computer group started 
working on an upgrade that became the Apple lie. The "e" 
represented enhanced. Apple intended this upgrade to 
extend the life of the Apple II. Peter Quinn was the 
chief engineer and Walt Broedner a principal in the 
development of the new design. Apple retained the 
enclosure style of the Apple II computer but completely 
redesigned the interior. The new design significantly 
reduced the number of integrated circuit chips. Two 
custom MOS chips and 64K bit memory chips contributed to 
this reduction. The company announced the Apple lie with 
the Lisa computer in January 1983. 


10/12 Paitm 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 

The computer used a MOS 65 02A microprocessor with 

64K bytes of RAM, expandable to 128K. The storage system 
supported six 140K byte 5.25-inch floppy disk drives and 
the terminal could display 24 lines of 40-column text in 
both uppercase and lowercase characters. The unit had a 
new 63-key keyboard adapted from the Apple III computer. 

The programs in the 1 6K of ROM were the Applesoft 
BASIC interpreter, system monitor routine, BO-column 
display firmware and self-test routines. The company 
also released the Apple Writer lie word processor and 
QuickFile lie data base application programs. The 
majority of Apple II and Apple II Plus programs and 
peripheral cards were compatible with the Apple lie. 

The base list price for a standard unit was 
51,395. A typical system with a single Apple Disk II 
drive and controller, 64K bytes of RAM, BO-column text 
card, and a monochrome monitor had a price of 51,995. An 
Apple Disk II drive and controller had a cost of 5545. 
The 80-column text card cost 5125 and the extended 
memory 8 0-column card that included an additional 64K 
bytes of memory cost 5295. 

Apple enhanced the Apple lie computers with four 
new high-performance chips in March 1985. The new chips 

monitor ROM chips and the 6502 with a 65C02 


additional update of the Apple lie occurred in January 
1987, that incorporated the Apple IIGS keyboard and 

Apple lie 

Apple introduced the Apple lie at an "Apple II 
Forever" conference in San Francisco, California in 
April 1984. The "c" stood for compact . Peter Quinn who 
was the chief engineer for the Apple lie, was also 
engineering manager of the lie design team. It was a 
portable computer that would be in competition with the 
IBM PCjr. The computer used additional custom integrated 


Apple Computer iu the 1980"s 10/13 

number of chips on the motherboard. Dimensions of the 
computer were 12 by 11.5 by 2.25 inches and the weight 
was 7.5 pounds. A German design company styled the 

bytes of RAM . The unit had one built-in half-height 
5. 2 5- inch 14 OK byte floppy disk drive and the monitor 
could display 24 lines of 40 or 80-column text. The 
computer was a closed-hardware architecture with no 
expansion slots and the power supply was an external 
unit. The housing integrated a 63-key keyboard that was 
functionally a duplicate of The Apple lie keyboai/d . 

printer called Scribe were released with the computer 
introduction. Also announced but not available at the 
introduction, was a flat-panel display that Apple 
intended to introduce by the end of 1984. 

Apple had updated the lie ROM software that 
contained the Applesoft BASIC interpreter and various 
routines. The computer used the new ProDOS operating 
system that provided for hierarchical directory 
structures. Most of the Apple II application programs 
were capable of running on the lie computer. The basic 
computer had a price of $1,295. 

Apple introduced an enhanced Apple lie in 
September 1986. Then they introduced a less expensive 
Apple lie Plus that incorporated a faster 4 MHz version 
of the 65C02 microprocessor, an internal 3.5-inch disk 
drive and a built-in power supply in September 1988 . The 
Apple lie Plus had a price of only $675 or $1,099 with a 


Apple IIGS 

The success of the Apple lie, the availability of 
a compatible 16-bit microprocessor and a new Mega II 

Apple IIGS. The "GS" stands for graphics and sound. The 
Apple IIGS computet evolved from the 1982/83 Apple IIx 
project. Principals in the engineering design were Dan 
Hillman, Harvey Lehtman, Rob Moore and Wozniak. The GS 

as Phoenix, Cortland and Rambo. Hillman and Jay Rickard 


10/14 Paitm 1980's~ The IBM/Macintosh era 

developed the Mega II as a cost reduction project, that 
resulted in the integration of most Apple II functions 
on a single chip. The new 16-bit computer incorporated 
enhanced graphics, advanced sound capabilities, expanded 
memory and an Apple II emulation mode . Apple introduced 
the Apple IIGS in September 1986. 

The computer used a Western Design Center W65C816 
microprocessor and 256K bytes of RAM, expandable to B 
megabytes. The storage system included support for both 
3.5-inch 800K byte and 5.25-inch 140K byte floppy disk 
drives. The terminal could display 24 lines of 40 or 80- 
column text. The keyboard was a separate unit with 80 
keys and a 14-key numeric keypad. The standard system 
included a mouse. Apple also introduced an optional 20 
megabyte hard disk designated 20SC for use with the 
computer. A computer system with a monochrome monitor 
and one 3.5-inch disk drive had a price of about 51,500. 

Apple provided a new operating system called 
ProDOS 16 for the 16-bit native mode and ProDOS 8 for 
the Apple lie emulation mode. ROM software included; the 
Applesoft BASIC interpreter, mouse based system 
utilities and a desktop environment with similarities to 
the Macintosh computer. QuickDraw II provided a set of 
graphic routines. Most of the existing Apple II software 
was compatible with the Apple IIGS. Apple released a new 
more powerful and flexible 16-bit operating system 
called GS/OS in September 1988. 

The company released an enhanced Apple IIGS in 
August 1989. The new computer had 256K bytes of ROM and 
1 megabyte of RAM. The ROM software included a number of 


William "Trip" Hawkins had developed a marketin 
plan describing the requirements for the Lisa compute 

by March 1980. Larry Tesler who had demonstrated th 
advance Xerox Alto computer systems to Apple in Decembe 
1979, joined the Lisa design team in July 1980 an 
became the manager of software development. Rich Pag- 
who was the chief hardware architect, had just complete 


Apple Computer iu the 1980"s 10/15 

a prototype of the Lisa computer incorporating a sample 
Motorola 68000 microprocessor. The Lisa name now denoted 
Local Integrated Software Architecture. 

Once again, as in the Apple III product, Jobs was 
affecting the design with numerous changes . This 
resulted in the departure of Ken Rothmueller and the 
appointment of Wayne Rosing as engineering manager. It 
also resulted in Mike Scott and Markkula advising Jobs 
in September that he would no longer be heading the Lisa 
project. In anticipation of the public stock offering 
and to placate Jobs they promoted him to chairman of the 
board. As part of a new corporate reorganization, John 
Couch became the general manager of the Lisa product 
group. 

Apple had integrated and extended the Xerox PARC 
(Palo Alto Research Center! graphical concepts in both 
the hardware and software. Bill Atkinson, Tesler and 
others developed the operating system and bit-mapped 

environment f-:-u the uss:. Ti":e Cv";:.:tr: wa =.: ie :=.: i :;ne::i :i 

windows concept, icons, a standard user program 

direct manipulation of screen objects by the mouse. 
Apple had achieved a new "state of the art" for personal 

computer software . 

However A;; pie was having p i" o b 1 e in s with the Twiggy 
floppy disk drive for Lisa. They decided to redesign the 
drive and have it produced by the Alps Electric Company, 
a Japanese manufacturer. Apple provided a preview of the 
Lisa computer to the Manhattan East Coast media then 
officially announced its introduction in January 198 3. 
However the late delivery of disk drives from Alps 
Electric delayed shipment of computers until May. 

The computer used a Motorola MC68000

disk named ProFile. The computer housing enclosed the 
12-inch monitor and two floppy disk drives. The keyboard 
was a separate unit and included a numeric key pad. The

company also developed a suite of seven application 
programs called the Lisa Office System. LisaDraw 
provided drawing capability for lines, boxes, circles 
and other features with mouse control. LisaWrite was a 
what-you-see-is-what-you-get word processor developed by 
Tom Malloy, another Xerox PARC recruit. LisaCalc was a 
sophisticated spreadsheet program. LisaGraph was a 


Apple Computer in the 1980's 10/17 

program with searching, sorting and reporting 

capabilities. LisaProject was a PERT (Program Evaluation 

and Review Technique) program with capabilities for 
displaying Gantt and task charts. LisaTerminal was a 
communications program with emulation capabilities for 
the DEC VT52, DEC VT100 and Teletype ASR-33 terminals. 
AppleNet software was also available for connecting 
multiple Lisa installations. 

A Lisa system with one megabyte of RAM, two floppy 
disk drives, a ProFile hard disk and seven application 
programs sold for 59,995. A C.Itoh dot-matrix printer 
cost about $700 and a Qume letter quality printer was 
about $2,100. The company targeted the Lisa computers as 
office systems with pricing that excluded Apple's 
traditional personal user. Unfortunately at the Lisa 

computer. He stated that the Macintosh would cost $2,000 
compared to $10,000 for the Lisa. This and the lack of 
compatibility between the two computers would affect 
future sales of the Lisa computer. Apple unbundled the 
suite of software and reduced the Lisa price to $6, 995 
in September. 

Apple announced the Lisa 2 family of computers at 

the annual shareholders meeting in January 1984. The 
company changed the design and pricing to counteract 
marketing concerns related to the new Macintosh 

computer . 

Apple released three models for what they called 
the Apple 32 SuperMicro product line. Those three models 
were the Lisa 2, Lisa 2/5 and Lisa 2/10. Each of the 
models used the same Motorola MC68000 microprocessor as 
the Lisa and had 512K bytes of user memory. The number 
of floppy disk drives on each model changed from two 
5. 25-inch Twiggy's to a single 3. 5-inch Sony drive as 
used on the Macintosh. The Lisa 2 had no hard drive and 
sold for $3,495. The Lisa 2/5 had an external 5-megabyte 
ProFile hard drive and sold for $4,495. The Lisa 2/10 


10/18 Paitm 1980's-TheroM/Maciutosh era 

had an internal 10-megabyte hard drive and sold for 
55, 495. 

An operating system software package called 
MacWorks was available that enabled all three models to 
run Macintosh application programs. However one 
potential problem was that the Macintosh pixel display 
was square, whereas the Lisa pixel display was 
rectangular. The Lisa Office application programs 
required a model with a hard drive and a memory card to 
extend the memory to one megabyte. Apple also announced 
a new AppleBus for a small-scale local- are a network to 
connect peripherals. It also facilitated the transfer of 
files be:weer. the Li = a ar.cl MaciiiTcsti commute _" :;yi:^:'i. 

Conclusion 

Corp-i-rate America die; no: accept the Li.sa computer 

not compatible with either IBM or the Macintosh and the 
price was too high. Sales were significantly below 
marketing forecasts in 1984. Then in January 1985 Apple 
renamed the Lisa 2/10 computer Macintosh XL and reduced 
the price to 53,995. The XL denoted extra-large or ex- 
Lisa. Apple discontinued the other two Lisa models. This 
however did not result in any significant sales increase 
and Apple discontinued the computer in April 1985. 

10.5 ... Macintoshes 

Development and Release 

Under Jef Raskin's direction, Brian Howard and 
Burrell Smith had completed prototypes using the 
Motorola M6809E microprocessor. Raskin had also hired 
Guy "Bud" L. Tribble to develop the Macintosh software. 
In September 1980 the board considered cancellation of 
the project due to problems with the Apple III and Lisa 
computers. After Jobs' separation from the Lisa product 
development in September, he started looking at the low- 
cost Macintosh project. Jobs now questioned Raskin's 
selection in 1979 of the Motorola M680SE microprocessor 
with its limited capabilities. Jobs supported a proposal 
by Burrell Smith and Bud Tribble to change the 


Apple Computer ill the 1980's 10/19 

microprocessor to the Motorola MC68000 and had a new 
prototype constructed by December. The new design had 
many capabilities comparable to the Lisa, at 

significantly lower cost. Jobs perceived the Macintosh 
as being a suitable successor to the Apple II. 

Jobs became the Macintosh manager and was given 
authorization to change the Macintosh development from 
"project" to "product" status. The time frame for the 
new product development would be twelve months. In 
January 1981 Jobs increased the staff by moving key 
Apple II people to the Macintosh development group. 
Principals in tj-.e hardware development •.■.'ere B.rrell 
Smith and Rod Holt. In the software development the 
principals were Bud Tribble the software manager, Bill 
Atkinson, Andy Hertzfeld, Bruce Horn and Randy 
Wigginton. Industrial designers Jerry Manock and Terry 
Oyama designed the computer enclosure. Differences in 
management and technical issues developed between Jobs 

development group in 1981, and resigning from Apple 
Computer in March 1982. Jobs had also supported the 

removal of Mike Scott as president in March 1981 and was 
now in a stronger position to control the destiny of the 
Macintosh computer within the company. Apple established 
a target date of early 1982 to ship the new Macintosh. 

Jobs made a number of significant design decisions 
during 1981 . The "footprint" of the new computer would 
be no larger than a telephone directory to minimize the 
space occupied by the computer on a desktop. After 
various mockups of the case, Manock finalized the 
enclosure design by early summer. The enclosure 
integrated the monitor and floppy disk drive within the 
case . The unit had a detached keyboard. There would be 
no expansion slots; Apple decided that software would be 
the means to expand the capabilities of the computer. A 
set of software tools within ROM would facilitate 
program development and provide a consistency in the 
user interface. Apple had outside suppliers write most 
of the application programs. 

In the spring of 1981, Jobs visited Paul Allen and 
Bill Gates at Microsoft to discuss the requirements for 


10/20 Paitm 1980's-TheffiM/Maciutosh era 

Microsoft to supply a spreadsheet, a chart program and a 
BASIC interpreter for shipment with the Macintosh. At 
this time Microsoft was busy developing software for the 
new IBM E'er sons 1 Computer . However after visit i-g Apple 
and seeing a presentation of the Macintosh, they reached 
an agreement in January 1982 to provide the software 
requested by Jobs. Microsoft adapted the spreadsheet 
program from Multiplan, the charting program became 
MacGraph and work on the adaptation of a BASIC 
interpreter began. 

The executive management approved production of 
the Macintosh computer in December 1981 with shipment 
date targeted for October 1982. However in early 1982 
the introduction date of the Macintosh changed to May 
1983. Jobs decided to assemble the Macintosh computer 
using advanced robotic techniques in a highly automated 
factory. They would also utilize a cost-effective 
Japanese concept of "just-in-time" for delivery of 
production parts . 

The software manager, Bud Tritable left Apple in 
19 82 . Robert L. Belleville replaced him and became 
director of Macintosh engineering. Bill Atkinson, Steve 
Capps, Andy Hertzfeld, Bruce Horn and Larry Kenyon 
designed the operating system. Bill Atkinson had the 
experience of being a principal in the development of 
the Lisa operating system. Horn and Capps developed the 
Finder program for file and program control in the 
desktop envi i/onment . A di/awir.g p:0(jL" = iii named Mac ": : ketch 
that became MacPaint, and an interface program called 
Toolbox by Hertzfeld were also under development 
internally. Apple assigned Donn Denman to develop a 

BASIC programming language called MacBASIC. A potential 
marketing problem for the Macintosh and Lisa computers 
was developing. It was their lack of compatibility in 
operating systems, programs and data files. 

Jobs had arranged for Randy Wigginton to write a 
word processing program for the Macintosh, when he 
decided tc leave Ap;:-le . However Jsbs was determined to 
have Wigginton write the word processing program. In 
December 1981 Jobs offered Wigginton royalties up to $1 
million if he developed the software on-time for the 
Macintosh delivery date. Wigginton demonstrated his

This allowed the lines to break on the screen at the 
same place they break on the printer, a What-You-See-Is- 
What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) system. 

Jobs was also having problems with the Macintosh 
name . Although Raskin had changed the spelling, Mcintosh 

their trademark. Apple subsequently made a payment to 
Mcintosh Laboratories to license the rights to use the 
Macintosh name. 

In January 1983, problems with the Twiggy floppy 
disk drive resulted i- the computer introduction date 
being moved to August . By the summer, Alps Electric was 
still having problems, Apple therefore decided to use a 
new 3.5-inch disk drive developed by Sony. The disk had 
a greater capacity and a more protective plastic case. 
However this resulted in the computer introduction date 
being delayed again. Apple announced the introduction to 
the public in a dramatic Orwellian commercial during the 
Super Bowl football game in January 1984. The official 
introduction was two days later on January 24th, at the 
annual shareholder's meeting. 

The computer used a Motorola MC68000 

microprocessor with 128K bytes of RAM. The storage 
system had one integral 3.5-inch 400K byte floppy disk 
drive from Sony. The disk controller used a single 
large-scale integrated chip called IWM (Integrated Woz 
Machine) . It was a one-chip integration of the disk 
controller functions as developed by Wozniak for the 
Apple Disk II drive. The display was a 9-inch monochrome 
monitor. The computer had a small 9.75 by 10.9 inch 
footprint and was 13.5 inches high with no expansion 
slots and a separate keyboard. The computer system 
utilized a single-button mouse similar to the Lisa

The price of the Macintosh was $2,495, an 
ImageWriter printer $595 and a second 3.5-inch disk 
drive $495. Prior to introduction Apple devised a unique 
marketing strategy to increase initial sales. They 
formed an Apple University Consortium (AUC) that offered 
the Macintosh to students and faculty for a flat $1,000.

about four times the speed of a Macintosh SE . The unit 
had an open NuBus architecture developed at MIT. The 13-

Apple released an implementation of the AT&T UNIX 
operating system called A/UX, for the Macintosh in 1988. 

Otiter Macintosh Developments 

In March 1988, a software project called Pink was 
started to develop a next-generation operating system. 
The new system would incorporate advance features, 
including object-based technology and preemptive 

leader. Another development that became the Blue project 
was started to improve the current operating system. 
This became the System 7 operating system released in 
1991 . 

Apple introduced the Macintosh IIx in September 
1988. It used the Motorola MC68030 microprocessor and 
68882 math coprocessor. The computer had a price of 
57,769. Early in 1989, Apple released the Macintosh 
SE/30 that used the Motorola MC68030 microprocessor. 
Then shortly after, Apple released the powerful modular 
Macintosh Ilex. Apple introduced the Macintosh Ilci in 
September 1989. It was a high-performance version of the 
Mac IIx operating at 25 MHz. The computer had a price of 
56,269.

Chapter 13 Other Software in the 1980' s 

The 1980' s began with a continuation in the shift 
from the technical programming language enthusiast, to 
the increased use of application software. Business 
productivity programs such as databases, spreadsheets 
and word processors became a major segment of the 
software market. The release of more powerful 
microprocessors, less expensive memory and storage 
devices accelerated these changes. Ease-of-use and user 
friendly were the terms used to describe the new focus 
for software in the 1980' s. Incorporation of innovative 
graphics helped to establish this new focus. These 
market demands and the introduction of the IBM Personal 
Computer in 1981, resulted in major changes and a rapid 
expansion of the software industry. However, between 
1983 and 1984, a severe downturn in the personal 
computer industry, caused significant financial problems 
for a number of software companies . The operating system 
segment of the software market also experienced 
significant change. 

13.1... Operating Systems 

Seattle Computer Products 

Seattle Computer Products, Inc., had developed an 
Intel 8086 microprocessor card for the S-100 bus in May 
1979. They reguired a 16-bit disk operating system and 
proposed to use Digital Research CP/M-86 which had been 
promised for the end of 1979. In April 1980 CP/M-86 was 
not available and Seattle Computer Products decided to 
develop its own operating system. It was written by Tim 
Paterson and called QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating 
System) because it was created so guickly (in two man- 
months) . QDOS 0.1 was released in August 198 0. 

QDOS was similar to CP/M. Paterson obtained 
compatibility with CP/M by incorporating a translator 
that converted 8080 instructions into 8086 instructions. 
He then provided eguivalent CP/M functions to operate on 
the 8086 microprocessor. Paterson also improved the data 


13/1 


13/2 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

storage capabilities and file organization of QDOS as 
compared to CP/M by using the Microsoft concept of a 
file allocation table (FAT) . This concept controlled the 
disk format and space allocation. 

Seattle Computer Products contacted Microsoft in 
early August regarding adapting 808 6 BASIC to QDOS and a 
possible cross-licensing agreement. In September 1980 
Microsoft purchased non-exclusive rights to the Seattle 
Computer Products operating system. Then in November 
1980 Microsoft signed a contract with IBM to provide a 
variety of software including an operating system for 
their new PC Computer. A new version of the operating 
system called 86-DOS 0.3 was released in late 1980. 
Version 1.0 was released in April 1981 which was very 
similar to Microsoft MS-DOS. Then Tim Paterson left 
Seattle Computer Products and joined Microsoft in May 
1981. Microsoft purchased all rights to the Seattle 
Computer Products disk operating system, in July 1981 

Digital Research 

In late August 1980, IBM visited Digital Research 
to negotiate the possible use or adaptation of CP/M for 
its new PC computer. However Digital Research would not 
sign an IBM non-disclosure agreement that resulted in a 
termination of the meeting. Then in September it became 
apparent that Digital Research would not assign the 
resources reguired to provide a 16-bit version of CP/M 
in the time schedule reguired by IBM. This resulted in 
IBM selecting Microsoft to provide the PC computer 
operating system. 

The negotiations with IBM were indicative of 
company organizational problems. This resulted in John 
Rowley being hired as president in November 1981. 

CP/M-8 6 was a 16-bit version of the CP/M operating 
system developed by Digital Research for the Intel 8086 
microprocessor. Some early copies were available in 
1981, however it was not released for use on the IBM 
Personal Computer until April 1982 . The software was 
priced from $175 to $240, which was considerably higher 
than the $60 IBM charged for the Microsoft operating 
system. The price was subseguently reduced, but the late 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/3 

release, higher price and a lack of support from IBM 
limited sales. 

Concurrent CP/M-8 6 is a program developed by 
Digital Research during 1982/83 to enable multitasking. 
This provided the capability of running up to four 
processes or programs at the same time. The company also 
developed another operating system called Concurrent DOS 
for the DOS environment in 198 4. 

Then in May 1988, Digital Research released 
Version 3.3 of DR-DOS (Digital Research - Disk Operating 
System), an operating system compatible with MS-DOS. 
This first release of DR-DOS was followed by Version 
3.40 in January 1989 and Version 3.41 in June 1989. 

Microsoft 

Microsoft entered the operating system segment of 
the software market when it developed XENIX in August 

1980. Then with the release of the IBM PC computer in 
August 1981, Microsoft became a significant provider of 
operating system software (see Sections 12.2 and 12.3) . 
See Appendix B for a description of the different 
versions and corresponding release dates of DOS. 

IBM 

IBM contracted with Microsoft to provide the 
operating system for its PC computer released in August 

1981. IBM added some utilities to the Microsoft 
operating system and called it PC-DOS. Then in 1984 IBM 
entered into a joint development agreement with 
Microsoft to develop a new operating system that became 
OS/2 (see Section 9.5). 

Apple Computer 

Apple Computer released the Sophisticated 
Operating System (SOS) for the Apple III computer in May 
1980. It was one of the earliest operating systems to 
have installable device drivers. 

The Professional Disk Operating System (ProDOS) 
was developed for the Apple II computer and evolved from 
the Apple III computer SOS operating system. It also 
resulted from a reguirement to provide an interface with 
peripheral devices other than the Disk II drive, a 


13/4 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

hierarchical directory structure and peripheral device 
drivers. ProDOS was released in January 1984 and was 
subsequently renamed ProDOS 8. 

The Professional Disk Operating System 16 (ProDOS 
16) was a 16-bit operating system released with the 
Apple IIGS computer in September 198 6. 

The GS/OS native operating system was released for 
the Apple IIGS computer in September 198 8. It 
incorporated the concept of File System Translators 
(FST's) to determine disk format for the selection of 
device drivers. Version 5 of the Apple IIGS System 
software was released in May 1989. It was a significant 
upgrade of the system software with improvements in 
performance, graphics and file operations. 

Other Operating Systems 

Douglas L. Michels founded The Santa Cruz 
Operation (SCO) , Inc. in 1979. The company started 
developing UNIX-based operating systems in the early 
1980's. 

UCSD p-System is an operating system that included 
UCSD Pascal. It was provided by SofTech Microsystems for 
the IBM Personal Computer released in 1981. It had a 
price of about $450. 

Mach is a UNIX based micro-kernel operating system 
developed by Richard (Rick) Rashid at Carnegie-Mellon 
University in the mid 1980's. It was designed to be 
portable to many types of hardware and multiprocessor 
computers. It formed the basis for the NeXTSTEP 
operating system and influenced the design of the 
Microsoft Windows NT operating system. 

NeXTSTEP is a UNIX-based operating system released 
with the NeXT computer in October 1988. Avidis Tevanian 
who had been one of the lead designers of the UNIX Mach 
system at Carnegie-Mellon University, was the chief 
software designer at NeXT. IBM subsequently licensed 
NeXTSTEP with the intent of adapting the system for its 
new workstation. 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/5 

Operating System User Interfaces 

Operating system user interfaces received a lot of 
attention from hardware and software suppliers between 
1980 and 1983. Apple Computer had developed a graphical 
user interface for the Lisa and Macintosh computers. 
VisiCorp demonstrated Vision in late 1982 and Microsoft 
had initiated an extensive development of a system that 
would become Windows (see Section 12.4) in 1983. 

Vision is a multiwindow graphical environment 
program that was demonstrated by VisiCorp (formerly 
Personal Software) at the November 1982 COMDEX show in 
Las Vegas. VisiCorp released the program in November 
1983. It had taken between two to three years to develop 
under the code name of Quasar. William T. Coleman was 
the group manager responsible for the development of 
Vision and related application programs. The software 
interfaced between the IBM PC operating system and user 
application programs. It utilized high resolution 
graphics, a mouse and had its own application programs. 
It was machine and device independent. The program cost 
$495 at introduction, then after poor sales the price 
was reduced to $95. However Vision could only run 
programs written for the interface. The only programs 
available at the release were VisiCalc, VisiGraph and 
VisiWord from VisiCorp. This limitation was detrimental 
to its widespread acceptance. Vision created financial 
difficulties for VisiCorp. Control Data Corporation 
subseguently purchased the Vision software. 

DESQ is a windowing system developed by 
Quarterdeck Office Systems in May 1984. It could 
multitask DOS programs but did not have a graphical 
interface. It was not successful. Quarterdeck 
subseguently developed DESQview for use with IBM TopView 
in July 1985. 

Digital Research developed GEM (Graphics 
Environment Manager) . Lee Lorenzen was a principal in 
the software development. It had a graphical user 
interface with a "look and feel" similar to the 
Macintosh computer, but could not multitask DOS 
programs . It was demonstrated at the COMDEX show in 
October 198 4. The company also developed a number of 
application programs for use with the system. During 


13/6 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

1985 changes were made to the user interface, due to 
threatened litigation by Apple because of the 
similarities to Macintosh. 

Hewlett-Packard developed NewWave PC that is an 
interface for use with Microsoft Windows. HP announced 
NewWave in November 198 7. It included additional 
features to make Windows easier to use that had 
similarities to the Apple Macintosh system. This 
resulted in litigation by Apple Computer in March 1988. 

Berkeley Softworks released GEOS (Graphic 
Environment Operating System) that was ProDOS-compatible 
in March 1988. It had a Mac-style desktop, word 
processor and spelling checker. 

Other operating system interfaces are Microsoft 
Windows (see Section 12.4) , IBM Presentation Manager and 
TopView (see Section 9.5) and a TopView clone called 
Mondrian. Metaphor Computer Systems is a company founded 
by David Liddle and Donald Massaro in 1983, that 
developed a windows-like graphical user interface for 
the PC computer. 

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) 
developed the X Window System for the UNIX operating 
system. The X Window System is a graphical 
communications interface that provides a standard way of 
controlling graphic displays from one X Window System to 
another. Graphical user interfaces that have been 
developed for the X Window System are DECwindows, Open 
Look by UNIX International and OSF/Motif by the Open 
Software Foundation. 


Other Software m the 1 980's 13/7 

13.2 ... Programming Languages 
BASIC 

As a result of demands for structured programming 
concepts, Dartmouth College developed a powerful BASIC 
compiler in 1983, called Dartmouth Structured BASIC, 
also known as SBASIC. After many conflicting 
requirements and technological changes since the 
formation of a standards committee in 1974, the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) completed a draft 
for a "full" BASIC standard in 1983. This led Dartmouth 
College to develop a compiler based on the new standard 
that would be portable to most personal computers. 
Dartmouth released this new compiler named True BASIC in 
1984. 

During the 1980' s, the availability of more 
powerful computers and increased memory, resulted in a 
move from interpreters to compilers for new BASIC 
programming languages . Examples of these are the Digital 
Research CBASIC-8 6 compiler, Microsoft QuickBASIC and 
the Tandy Radio Shack RSBASIC compiler 

Borland announced Turbo BASIC at the fall COMDEX 
show in November 198 6. 

c 

Borland released Turbo C at a price of $99.95 in 
the late 1980's. 

C++ 

B j arne Stroustrup developed the C++ programming 
language at Bell Telephone Laboratories. C++ is an 
object-oriented extension of the C language. C++ became 
available in 1986. 

Logo 

In the summer of 1982 Logo became available for 
the Apple II and TI-99/4A computers. 


13/8 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

Modula-2 

Modula-2 is a general purpose systems 
implementation language based on the use of modules. It 
was developed by Niklaus Wirth after a number of years 
research on the capabilities of Pascal. The initial 
Modula language was described by Wirth in 1977 and an 
improved version Modula-2 was available in 1982. 

The first commercial implementation of Modula-2 
was announced by Volition Systems in December 1982. It 
was released for a number of computers including the 
Apple II, Apple III and 8080/Z80 based systems. 

Oberon 

Oberon is an object-oriented systems programming 
language developed by professors Niklaus Wirth and Jurg 
Gutknecht at the ETH (Eidgenossische Technische 
Hochschule) in Zurich, Switzerland. The language is a 
distillation of the best features from Pascal and 
Modula-2 . Oberon is smaller and simpler than its 
predecessors. The software was developed in conjunction 
with CERES, which was a single-board graphics 
workstation. Work on the language began in 1985. Wirth 
named the language in tribute to the precision of the 
Voyager spacecraft as it flew past Uranus ' s moon of the 
same name (Oberon) in 1988. Implementations are 
available for Apple Mac II ' s, DEC DECstations, IBM RISC 
System/6000 workstations, Intel based PC's and Sun 
SPARCstations . 

Pascal 

Microsoft developed a Pascal compiler for the IBM 
PC in April 1983 that had a price of $300. Then in March 
1989 Microsoft released Quick Pascal. 

UCSD Pascal was originally developed at the 
University of California, San Diego (UCSD) . The UCSD 
system included the programming language and the UCSD 
operating system and was supplied by SofTech 
Microsystems, Inc. 

Philippe Kahn moved from France to the USA and 
founded Borland International, Inc. in 1983. Turbo 
Pascal was the first product developed by Kahn. The 
compiler was introduced by an advertisement in the 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/9 

November 1983 issue of Byte magazine at a price of only 
$49.95. It was an innovative program with an integrated 
programming environment. It facilitated program 
development by having a built-in text editor from which 
one could compile, correct errors and run the program. 
The program was an immediate success. Some other 
programs released by Borland are the Paradox database, 
Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Sidekick. 

PL/I 

Digital Research developed a three-pass compiler 
for PL/I in 1980. The compiler was written in PL/M and 
was based on the G Subset of PL/I which was an 
adaptation for minicomputers. The first two passes 
produced symbol tables and intermediate language 
suitable for various hardware systems. The third pass, 
optimized the code and developed the final machine code 
for a specific system. 

13.3... Word Processors 

The 1980' s was a period of transition for word 
processing. The market changed from companies such as 
IBM, Lanier and Wang Laboratories supplying dedicated 
word processors, to the use of general purpose personal 
computers and word processing software from other 
independent companies . The dominant companies changed in 
1983 from Wang to MicroPro providing Word-Star, then to 
the WordPerfect Corporation in 1986. However by 1989, 
Microsoft Word and WordPerfect had close to egual shares 
of the market. 

EasyWriter 

In 1981, IBM negotiated with Bill Baker of 
Information Unlimited Software (IUS) to adapt the Apple 
II EasyWriter word processor for their new personal 
computer. An agreement was reached and John Draper with 
assistance from Larry Weiss of IUS developed the program 
for the IBM PC. It had a price of $175 and was released 
with the support of IBM in August 1981. The program did 
not receive good reviews. However, it had good initial 


13/10 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

sales, because it was the only word processor available 
for the IBM PC at its introduction. Improvements were 
made to the program, but it did not compete successfully 
with later word processors. In 1983, Computer Associates 
International purchased IUS from Bill Baker for over $10 
million. 

WordStar 

For the founding of MicroPro International and the 
introduction of Word-Star in 1979, see Section 7.3. 
MicroPro adapted Word-Star to the IBM PC in mid 1982 and 
it guickly gained a dominant share of the market. Other 
company products were CalcStar, DataStar and InfoStar, 
MailMerge and SpellStar. The company became a public 
corporation in March 1984. A new version of the word 
processor named Word-Star 2000 with a new interface was 
introduced at the fall COMDEX show in 1984. However it 
functioned slower and received a poor reception. This 
was a turning point in the dominance of MicroPro as the 
leading supplier of word processors. The company changed 
its name to WordStar International in 1989. 

WordPerfect 

Alan Ashton who was a Ph.D. graduate in computer 
science from the University of Utah, started developing 
the specification for a word processing program in the 
summer of 1977. The specification defined innovative 
features for word processors at that time. It included 
text scrolling, use of function keys and automatic on- 
screen editing. In 1978, Bruce Bastian started working 
with Ashton to develop the software for the word 
processor . 

A simplified version of the software called P-Edit 
for program editing was released and sold by an 
associate Don Owens. Ashton, Bastian and Owens then 
formed a company called Satellite Software International 
(SSI) in September 1979 to market P-Edit and the new 
word processor. The word processor was completed in 
March 1980 and called SSI*WP. The software only worked 
on a Data General computer system and the retail price 
of the program was $5,500. However the program was easy 
to use and fast. 


Other Software in the 1980's 13/11 

In October 1980, W. E. Pete Peterson who was a 
brother-in-law of Bastian joined the company. At the end 
of 1981 Owens was removed as an officer of the company 
and Peterson became manager of sales and marketing and 
subseguently an executive vice president. 

In early 1982 the company started adapting P-Edit 
for the IBM Personal Computer and completed the 
conversion in August. Work on the conversion of SSI*WP 
to the IBM PC was completed in the fall of 1982. The 
name WordPerfect was selected for the program, then it 
was announced to the press in October. WordPerfect was 
released as version 2.20 and shipped in November. The 
program had innovative features and the company provided 
excellent customer support. 

In early 1983, SSI purchased Don Owens share of 
the company for $139,000. Ashton and Bastian now owned 
50 percent each of the SSI stock. Peterson subseguently 
received a small percentage of the shares. Versions 3.0 
and 4.0 were released at the 1983 and 1984 fall COMDEX 
shows respectively. Also in 1984, the company name was 
changed to SSI Software. With the release of version 
4.0, reviews were very favorable and sales set new 
records in 1985. 

Other company products were MathPlan (later named 
PlanPerfect) , SSI*Data (later named DataPerfect) , a 
legal-time-and-billing system named SSI*Legal and a 
version of the Forth programming language named 
SSI*Forth. In 1986, the company name was changed to 
WordPerfect Corporation and WordPerfect became the 
leading word processing program. Executive WordPerfect, 
a "junior" version of WordPerfect was released for 
portable computers in May 1987. In 1988 the company 
released WordPerfect Office incorporating electronic 
mail for networks, a version of WordPerfect for the 
Apple Macintosh in April and version 5.0 of WordPerfect 
for the IBM PC in May 

In 1989, the tenth anniversary of the company 
founding, WordPerfect had achieved significant success. 
However with the release of graphical user interfaces by 
IBM in OS/2 and by Microsoft with Windows, increasing 
demands were occurring in the marketplace for 
WordPerfect to provide a graphical version of its word 


13/12 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

processor. Due to competitive concerns with Microsoft 
Word and higher expectations for the success of the IBM 
OS/2 operating system, the company decided to emphasize 
the development of a version of WordPerfect for OS/2 
first . 

Other Word Processors 

Paul Lutus developed a new word processor for the 
Apple II computer in 198 0, with a number of improvements 
as compared to his previous Apple Writer program. Lutus 
negotiated a royalty agreement for the program with 
Apple Computer instead of the flat fee received 
previously. The program called Apple Writer II was 
released by Apple Computer in 1981. It became a very 
popular word processor for the Apple II computer and 
made Lutus guite wealthy. 

Timothy E. Gill founded Quark, Inc., in 1981. Gill 
developed an early word processor called Word Juggler 
for the Apple III computer. Farhad Fred Ebrahimi 
purchased half of the company in 198 6. 

MultiMate is the name of a series of word 
processing programs initially developed by MultiMate 
International Corporation. The company was established 
in 1982 and was acguired by Ashton-Tate, in December 
1985. The first program developed was MultiMate 
Professional Word Processor. An improved version with 
additional advanced features was called MultiMate 
Advantage Professional Word Processor. An easy-to-use 
version of the program called MultiMate Executive Word 
Processor is also available. 

Camila Wilson developed Volkswriter and founded 
Lifetree Software Inc., in 1982. Volkswriter was 
introduced at the West Coast Computer Faire in March 
1982. The program was written in Microsoft Pascal. It 
was one of the earliest effective word processors for 
the IBM PC computer. It was priced at $195 and a deluxe 
version at $295. 

Bank Street Writer is a word processing program 
that was developed by a group of Boston programmers for 
Apple II computers. Br0derbund Software obtained the 
publication rights and released it in December 1982. 
Br0derbund subseguently released it for Atari computers. 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/13 

pf s : Write was developed by Software Publishing 
Corporation in the early 1980 ' s. It became a popular 
word processing program with significant market 
penetration. See Section 13.5 for initial developments 
at Software Publishing Corporation. 

Other word processing programs such as the Apple 
Computer MacWrite, IBM Displaywrite, Lotus Ami Pro 
(developed by the Samna company and subseguently became 
WordPro) , Microsoft Word and Sierra On-Line Homeword 
shared the market. See Section 12.6 for details of 
Microsoft Multi-Tool Word, Word and Word for Windows 
word processing programs. 


13.4 ... Spreadsheets 


Lotus 1-2-3 

Lotus 1-2-3 was co-developed by Mitchell D. Kapor 
and Jonathan M. Sachs in 1981. Sachs was a graduate in 
mathematics from MIT and spent fourteen years studying 
and working at various positions at MIT. In the mid 
seventies Sachs left MIT and supervised the development 
of an operating system at Data General. Following this 
he co-founded Concentric Data Systems where he designed 
a spreadsheet to run on Data General hardware. Kapor is 
a graduate in psychology from Yale University and 
partially completed a masters degree at MIT. In 1978/79 
Kapor co-developed a program called Tiny Troll and in 
1981 two programs called VisiPlot and VisiTrend. 

In 1981 Sachs and Kapor reached an agreement to 
adapt Sachs spreadsheet program for the new IBM Personal 
Computer. Sachs had strong technical experience, 
especially in assembly language and Kapor had successful 
commercial experience in program development, with 
special skills in the design of the user interface. 
Kapor and Sachs assigned the code name of TRIO to the 
software development project. 

To finance the initial development and company 
startup they contacted Sevin-Rosen Partners. Benjamin M. 
Rosen was a venture capitalist who had purchased Tiny 
Troll from Kapor. Rosen and his partner L. J. Sevin and 
other investors entered into an agreement to help 


13/14 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

finance with the development and introduction of the 
spreadsheet software. Lotus Development Corporation was 
founded in April 1982. The name Lotus was selected by 
Kapor, and comes from India where it is associated with 
the concept of perfect enlightenment. 

The program featured natural-order recalculation, 
integrated graphics capability for charting, had a 
limited database capability and provided a computer 
based user tutorial. However the program reguired 128K 
bytes of memory. The software was optimized for a PC 
computer with the increased memory capacity and took 
advantage of the more powerful capabilities of the Intel 
8088 microprocessor. The software was very fast in 
operation and achieved extra speed by going around DOS . 

Lotus 1-2-3, was announced in October 1982, 
demonstrated at the November 1982 COMDEX show in Las 
Vegas and shipped in January 1983. It was an immediate 
success and soon replaced VisiCalc as the dominant 
spreadsheet program. 

The company became a public corporation in October 
1983. An improved version 2.0 of Lotus 1-2-3 was 
released in November 1985. Jim P. Manzi became president 
of Lotus in 198 4 and chairman after the departure of 
Mitchell Kapor in July 198 6. Lotus 1-2-3/3 was a new 
improved version of Lotus 1-2-3 that was announced in 
April 1987 for IBM OS/2 systems. In September 1987 Lotus 
announced it would be delayed, it was finally released 
in June 1989. 

VisiCalc 

Reference Section 7.4 for the founding of Software 
Arts and the initial development of VisiCalc in 1979. 

In February 1980, Robert Frankston of Software 
Arts developed the DIF format for VisiCalc to facilitate 
data transfer. During 1980/81 Software Arts adapted 
VisiCalc to other computers such as the Atari, Commodore 
Pet, IBM PC and Radio Shack TRS-80. VisiCalc Advanced 
Version was released with additional features at the 
National Computer Conference in 1982. In early 1982, 
Personal Software, Inc. changed the name of the company 
to VisiCorp. Subseguently Software Arts and VisiCorp had 
disputes regarding the development and marketing of 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/15 

VisiCalc. In September 1983 it resulted in litigation, 
and in early 198 4 Software Arts terminated its marketing 
agreement with VisiCorp. The litigation was settled out- 
of-court in September 1984 in favor of Software Arts. 

Lotus 1-2-3 had significantly impacted the sales 
of VisiCalc. Also the development costs of Vision and 
the litigation had affected the financial viability of 
VisiCorp. VisiCorp merged with Palladin Software in 
November 198 4. Then Software Arts was purchased by Lotus 
Development Corporation for $6.5 million in April 1985. 
Daniel Bricklin became a consultant for Lotus, then he 
founded a new software publishing company called 
Software Garden, Inc. 

Other Spreadsheets 

See Section 10.4 for the Apple Computer LisaCalc 
and Section 12.6 for details of Microsoft Electronic 
Paper, Multiplan and Excel spreadsheets. 

SuperCalc was designed by Gary Balleisen and 
released by a company called Sorcim for the CP/M market. 
Richard Frank owned the company whose name is micros 
spelled backwards. Subseguently improvements were 
incorporated in the release of SuperCalc3 and SuperCalc5 
that featured 3-dimensional capabilities. The 
spreadsheet was acquired by Computer Associates 
International in 1984. 

Randy Wigginton developed Full Impact for the 
Macintosh in 198 9. The program was marketed by Ashton- 
Tate . 

Quattro Pro was a spreadsheet program developed by 
a company in Hungary and released by Borland 
International in 1987. Version 2.0 was released in 
November 1989. 

Other spreadsheet programs developed during the 
1980's were: Javelin by Javelin Software, pfs:Plan by 
Software Publishing, SCO Professional by Santa Cruz 
Operation, T/Maker by Heidi and Peter Roizen, VP-Planner 
by Paperback Software and WingZ for the Apple Macintosh 
by Informix. Spreadsheet add-on programs were released 
during the 1980' s to provide additional features. 
Examples of these are pf s : Graph by Software Publishing 


13/16 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

and a program called Sideways, which as the name 
suggests printed a spreadsheet sideways. 

13.5 ... Databases 

dBASE 

The dBASE database program was initially developed 
by C. Wayne Ratliff in 1979 under the name of Vulcan. 
However he was not able to market the software 
successfully. 

George Tate and Hal Lashlee founded a company 
called Software Plus as a discount mail-order software 
service in August 1980. In late 1980 they signed a 
marketing agreement with Wayne Ratliff to market his 
Vulcan database software. The company name was then 
changed to Ashton-Tate, Inc. The Ashton name does not 
represent anything and was selected for marketing 
considerations. Ratliff joined Ashton-Tate later as the 
chief scientist. 

The software was introduced as dBASE II for 8-bit 
computers with a CP/M operating system in January 1981. 
There never was a dBASE I, the II implied an improved 
product. It was one of the earliest full functional 
relational data base programs for personal computers. 
The software included capabilities for programming 
customized reguirements . The company offered innovative 
support services that guickly resulted in its success. 

In mid-1983 Ashton-Tate purchased the dBASE II 
technology and copyright from Wayne Ratliff. The company 
went public in November 1983. Version 2.4 of dBASE II 
was released in 1983 with capabilities to run on both an 
IBM PC computer and a CP/M operating system. 

dBASE III for 16-bit computers was released in May 
1984. It provided extended functions, pull-down menus 
and a limited networking capability. dBASE III PLUS was 
released with built-in multi-user capabilities in 
November 1985. A dBASE III PLUS LAN PACK was available 
to share dBASE III files in a network. dBASE Mac was 
released for the Apple Macintosh computer in September 
1987. However, it did not receive good reports. 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/17 

Oracle 

Lawrence J. Ellison, Robert N. Miner and Edward A. 
Oates founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) in 
June 1977. The company had just received a contract to 
provide software for a mass storage device. 

Before the contract was finished the company 
decided to diversify by developing a packaged software 
product. This new product would be a relational database 
system, that was first described by Edgar F. Codd of IBM 
in the June 1970 issue of the Communications of the ACM. 
It would also incorporate a Structured Query Language 
(SQL), developed by the System R (Relational) group at 
IBM's Research Laboratory in San Jose, California. SQL 
was the user interface for the database system. Miner 
and Bruce Scott were principals in the development of 
the new program that was named Oracle . The program was 
developed on a DEC minicomputer and was introduced in 
1978 . IBM had conceived the relational database system, 
but SDL had beaten them to the market (IBM did not 
release a relational system until February 1982) . 
Shortly after the introduction the company name was 
changed to Relational Software Inc. (RSI) then later to 
the Oracle Corporation. 

RSI's first customer was the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) . However the CIA reguired the database to 
run on other operating systems such as IBM's or DEC's 
VAX. This and other customer reguirements resulted in a 
rewrite of the database program in the C language to 
make it portable to different computer platforms. In the 
late 1980' s, an easy-to-use version of the Oracle 
database was developed for the Apple Macintosh computer. 
This was followed by a version to run on a personal 
computer using Microsoft Windows . The company also 
developed network and client-server software for the 
personal computer market. 

The company went public in 198 6 and is now the 
world's largest supplier of database software. Oracle 
Corporation is the second-largest independent software 
company after Microsoft. 


13/18 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

pfs:File 

Software Publishing Corporation (SPC) was founded 
in 1980 by three Hewlett-Packard associates, Janelle 
Bedke, Fred M. Gibbons and John D. Page. The initial 
impetus for establishing the company was by Gibbons . The 
company president is Gibbons, the vice president of 
software development is Page and the vice president of 
marketing is Bedke. Page had created a database for a 
minicomputer at Hewlett-Packard. He then developed SPC's 
first program called Personal Filing System, that was 
abbreviated to pfs:File 

The program was developed with the concepts of 
being simple, easy-to-use and of low cost. The program 
was written in Pascal with assembler routines for 
performance critical functions. The program was released 
in September 198 for the Apple II computer. 

Other programs such as pf s : Graph, pfs:Plan, 
pfs : Report and pfs:Word have been released using the 
same design concepts. The programs have also been 
adapted for various computers such as the IBM PC and 
Radio Shack models . IBM markets the pfs programs using 
the IBM Assistant series of labels. See Sections 13.3 
and 13.4 for additional details of other Software 
Publishing products. 

Other Databases 

Informix Software Inc., is another major database 
software company founded by Roger Sippl in 198 0. The 
company went public in 198 6 and Phillip E. White became 
the chief executive officer in 1989. 

Rupert Lissner developed QuickFile that was an 
early Apple II database program marketed by Apple 
Computer in 1980. A version for the Apple lie was 
subseguently released named QuickFile lie. 

Jim Button developed a simple inexpensive 
shareware database program called PC File. He founded a 
company called ButtonWare around 1983 that was one of 
the earliest shareware companies . 

Mark B. Hoffman and Robert S. Epstein founded 
Sybase, Inc., in 1984. The company developed relational 
databases, operating systems and now specializes in 
client-server software. The company went public in 1991. 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/19 

Laurent Ribardiere and Marylene Delbourg-Delphis 
of France developed the 4th Dimension database for the 
Apple Macintosh computer in 1985. The program was a 
powerful graphic database and was acguired by Apple 
Computer. However, due to pressure from Ashton-Tate who 
were developing dBASE for the Macintosh, Apple Computer 
decided not to release the program. The developers 
founded the French company Analyses Conseils 
Informations (ACI) to market the program. In April 1987, 
the company formed ACIUS to market the program in the 
USA and appointed Guy Kawasaki who had been an executive 
with Apple Computer as president of ACIUS. 

In 1987, Borland International bought Ansa 
Software and its database management system called 
Paradox. Borland released its version of Paradox in 
1989. 


13.6 ... Integrated Programs 


In the early 1980' s, integrated programs that 
combined features such as a word processor, spreadsheet 
and database became very popular. 

Context MBA 

Context MBA was a powerful integrated software 
package developed by Context Management Systems and 
released in July 1982 . It featured a powerful 
spreadsheet, communications program, database, graphics 
and word processor. To improve portability it was 
developed for the UCSD operating system. However the 
system was slow, was not user friendly and could not 
compete with the faster programs such as Lotus 1-2-3. 
The company subseguently went out of business. 

AppleWorks and 3 E-Z Pieces 

AppleWorks is an integrated software package 
developed by Rupert Lissner starting in 1982. It evolved 
from the QuickFile database program by Lissner and was 
initially called Apple Pie. The program was written in 
machine language. It is an integrated word processing, 


13/20 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

spreadsheet and database software package which was 
introduced for the Apple lie in November 1983. 

The program was marketed by Apple Computer and 
sold for $250. AppleWorks became one of the world's best 
selling programs and enhanced the sale of Apple lie 
computers. Its popularity resulted in the formation of 
the National AppleWorks Users Group (NAUG) . An improved 
Version 2.0 of AppleWorks was released in September 
1986. Then Apple Computer's subsidiary Claris 
Corporation, contracted with Beagle Bros, to develop a 
major update of the program. This was released as 
Version 3.0 in March 1989 and a networked version in 
August . 

A similar program called 3 E-Z Pieces was 
simultaneously developed by Lissner for the Apple III. 
Lissner sold the marketing rights for this program to 
Haba Systems . 

Subseguently a number of add-on enhancements were 
made for the AppleWorks program by other companies. 
Pinpoint Publishing released Pinpoint Desk Accessories 
in 1985 and Beagle Bros, released MacroWorks in June 
1986 and a series of TimeOut modules starting in 1987. 

3-Plus-l 

3-Plus-l is an integrated program that was 
developed by Commodore and included with their PLUS/4 
computer which was released in January 1984. The program 
included a word processor, spreadsheet, business 
graphics and a file manager. 

Symphony and Jazz 

Lotus Development Corporation introduced an 
integrated program called Symphony for the IBM Personal 
Computer in February 198 4. It was a five function 
integrated package with spreadsheet, business graphics, 
word processor, database manager and telecommunication 
capabilities. The project leader on the software 
development was Raymond Ozzie. However users felt it was 
too complex and sales were below expectations. 

Jazz is a five function integrated program by 
Lotus similar to Symphony but for use on the Apple 
Macintosh computer. It was announced in November 1984 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/21 

for release in March 1985, but the release was delayed 
until May. The software had a price of $595. However 
Jazz received mixed reviews. It was reported to be slow 
and lacked macros as on Lotus 1-2-3. The sales were to 
some extent affected by the release of the highly 
successful Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Lotus reduced 
the price of Jazz, but it was not a successful product. 

Framework 

The Framework software was developed by Robert 
Carr who has both a bachelor's and master's degree in 
computer science from Stanford University. Carr had 
previously worked on Context MBA and at the Xerox PARC 
(Palo Alto Research Center) on software for future 
products. In 1983, Carr co-founded Forefront Corporation 
with Marty Mazner. The company was financed by Ashton- 
Tate in exchange for marketing rights to the software. 
The software integrated a word processor, data base, 
spreadsheet, graphics and communication capabilities. 

The five function integrated software package 
named Framework was introduced by Ashton-Tate in July 

1984. In 1985 Ashton-Tate acguired Forefront Corporation 
and Carr became chief scientist. Framework II, a second 
generation of the software was introduced in September 

1985. It included improved functionality and ease of use 
features . 

First Choice 

Was released by Software Publishing Corporation 
(SPC) in 1986. First Choice was an easy to use program 
that integrated four popular programs into one package.

other integrated programs developed or released in the 
1980's. 

13. 7 ... Miscellaneous 

Accounting Programs 

Peachtree Software, Inc., started as a retail 
computer store in 1975 and changed to a software company 
in 1978 . It was one of the first companies to develop 
accounting software for personal computers . IBM selected 
Peachtree Software to provide an accounting package for 
the IBM Personal Computer in 198 0. The software was 
called the Business Accounting Series, that included 
general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, 
inventory management and payroll modules . Programs for 
the IBM PC computer were released in August 1981. 

In 1981, Peachtree Software became a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Management Science America Inc. Then in 
May 1985, Peachtree was purchased by Intelligent 
Systems. Bill Goodhew became the president and chief 
executive officer. Significant improvements and price 
reductions were made to the high-end software, that was 
renamed Peachtree Complete in 1986. Then in 1988, 
Goodhew, other management and outside investors 
purchased the company from Intelligent Systems . 

BIOS - Basic Input/Output Systems 

The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) for the IBM 
Personal Computer was developed by David J. Bradley in 
1980/81. The BIOS code controls the transfer of 
information between elements of the hardware system. IBM 
made the BIOS code proprietary by copyrighting it. This 
prevented other companies from using the BIOS unless the 
obtained a license from IBM, or reverse engineered it. 

Compag Computer Corporation was the first company 
to reverse engineer the functions of the IBM BIOS to 
obtain compatibility for their portable computer 
released in November 1982 . Then Neil Colvin who founded 
Phoenix Technologies Ltd., also reverse engineered the 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/23 

IBM BIOS software. Phoenix released a chip for IBM 
compatible computers in May 1984. These developments 
would have a significant impact on the creation of the 
IBM clone market. 

Computer Assisted Drafting (CAD) 

John Walker founded Autodesk, Inc., in 1982. The 
company purchased its main product AutoCAD that was 
designed by Michael Riddle. Autodesk is a major supplier 
of computer assisted drafting (CAD) software for use on 
personal computers by architects and engineers. The 
software is available in different versions. The company 
went public in 1985. 

Desktop Publishing 

Hardware technology that provided the bit-mapped 
screen and the WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) 
display of text enabled desktop publishing. The hardware 
technology was refined at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research 
Center) and implemented in a practical manner on the 
Macintosh computer. This software made a significant 
difference in the publishing process by utilizing a 
relatively inexpensive personal computer. Articles could 
be readily composed by manipulating text and graphics. 
The file could then be transferred digitally to a 
publishing company. 

John E. Warnock and Charles M. Geschke founded 
Adobe Systems Inc., in 1982. Their original product 
called PostScript was derived from technology that 
Warnock had developed at the University of Utah and 
Xerox PARC. Warnock had co-developed at PARC a language 
called JaM that stands for John and Martin (John Warnock 
and Martin Newell) . This language was the predecessor of 
PostScript that Adobe introduced in March 1985. The 
PostScript software contains a page description language 
that controls the text, graphics, images and color. This 
facilitates the communication of electronic documents . A 
special font technology enables the printing of 
virtually identical characters on various printers with 
different resolutions. The page-description language 
also enables a page to be printed with a mix of text and 
graphics at any resolution. Shortly after the founding 


13/24 Part III 1980's- The IBM/Macintosh era 

of Adobe, Apple Computer made a significant financial 
investment in the company. Steven Jobs wanted PostScript 
released for the new Macintosh computer and LaserWriter 
printer. Adobe Systems became a publicly held company in 
1986.

developed by Aldus initially for the Apple Macintosh 
computer and LaserWriter printer. Paul Brainerd and 
colleagues founded Aldus Corporation in 198 4 and 
released PageMaker in July 1985. It became a popular 
program and contributed significantly to an increase in 
sales of the Macintosh computer. The Aldus company was 
acquired by Adobe Systems in 1994. 

Ventura Software Inc., was founded in 1985 by 
three Digital Research employees. The company introduced 
in 198 6 the earliest desktop publishing program for the 
IBM PC, called Ventura Publisher. Ventura Software was 
acquired by Xerox Corporation in 1990, who sold it to 
Corel Corporation in 1993. 

Quark, Inc., initially founded as a word 
processing company, introduced QuarkXPress, a desktop 
publishing program in 198 7. Quark has become a leading 
supplier of desktop publishing programs. 

Timeworks released Publish It!, a desktop 
publishing program for the Apple II computer in January 
1988 . 

Games 

A lot of software has been developed to provide 
games for personal computers in the 1980' s. The 
following are a few of the more significant companies 
and their releases. 

Zork I was initially developed for mainframe 
computers by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels and 
Dave Lebling of MIT in 1977. The game was written using 
a MIT language called MDL. Albert Vezza who was chief of 
the programming research group wanted to commercialize 
some of the capabilities at MIT. Vezza, Joel Berez, the 
initial developers of Zork and other associates founded 


Other Software in the 1 980's 13/25 

Infocom Inc., in June 1979. The mainframe version of 
Zork I was then adapted for personal computers and 
released in December 1980. Joel Berez became president 
and Personal Software was the initial marketer of Zork. 
Zork II was released in 1981 and Deadline in 1982. 

Douglas G. Carlston and Gary Carlston were 
principals in the founding of Br0derbund Software, Inc., 
in February 198 0. Br0derbund is a Swedish word for 
brotherhood. The company released a battle game called 
Galactic Empire and a game of barter called Galactic 
Trader for the TRS-80 computer that had been programmed 
by Douglas Carlston. The games were offered for sale at 
the West Coast Computer Faire in April 198 0. The 
programs became part of the Galactic Saga series of 
games. Shortly after the games were converted to run on 
the Apple II computer. A distribution agreement with a 
Japanese company called Star Craft allowed Br0derbund to 
market their games. A number of games such as Alien 
Rain, Choplifter, Lode Runner, David's Midnight Magic 
and Space Quarks have been successful. Through the mid 
1980' s Br0derbund expanded its product line to include 
items other than games . Br0derbund released an 
educational program, "Where in the World is Carmen 
Sandiego?" that teaches geography in 1985. Gary Carlston 
left the company in 1989. 

Ken Williams and his wife Roberta Williams founded 
On-Line Systems in early 1980. Roberta Williams 
conceived a game situated in a mysterious house with 
challenges similar to the Adventure games introduced in 
the 1970' s. Ken Williams developed the software for the 
game program that included graphics of rooms inside the 
house. The program was introduced with the name Mystery 
House for the Apple II computer in May 198 0. The game 
became guite successful and another game called Wizard 
and the Princess was released shortly after. By 1982, 
the company name had changed to Sierra On-Line Inc. In 
1984, a game called King's Quest was released. 

Terry Bradley and Jerry Jewell founded Sirius 
Software in early 1980. The first entertainment products 
released by the company were developed by Nasir Gebelli.

Barrels, Cyber strike and Star Cruiser followed. Sirius 
became a major supplier of game software in the early 
1980' s. However, in the summer of 1984, the company had 
financial difficulties and became bankrupt. 

Bill Budge founded his own company called Budgeco 
in early 1981, to market a new game he had developed 
called Raster Blaster. The program was a computer 
version of a pinball game with innovative graphics. It 
simulated the bouncing of the steel ball, flippers and 
the effect of gravity. It became a very successful game 
program for the Apple II computer. Budge then developed 
another innovative program called Pinball Construction 
Set and marketed it through Electronic Arts. 

William "Trip" Hawkins who had been a manager at 
Apple Computer, founded Electronic Arts Inc., in 1982. 
The company is a creator and distributor of recreational 
software. Hawkins contracted with independent software 
developers and created a unigue company image by 
promoting these developers as software artists, similar 
to musicians, writers and other popular stars. Other 
company strategies were the direct distribution of its 
software to retailers, an innovative process for 
managing creative software development and technology 
leverage. Two early successful programs were Pinball 
Construction Set by Bill Budge, and Music Construction 
Set by Will Harvey. The company started developing video 
game systems in 1990 and Hawkins left Electronic Arts in 
1993 to start another game system company.

Chapter 14 Hardware in the 1990's 
14.1 ... Microprocessors 

IBM 

IBM introduced a new RISC central processing unit 
(CPU) for the RISC System/6000 workstation in February 
1990. The 32-bit superscalar CPU contained seven to nine 
VLSI CMOS chips using 1-micron technology with operating 
speeds of 20, 25 or 30 MHz. The architecture was called 
a "second generation RISC" by IBM. The CPU contained an 
instruction/branch unit, fixed point unit, floating 
point unit, data cache and storage input/output control 

Depending on the speed and configuration, the CPU could 
execute between 28 to over 40 million instructions per 
second (MIPS) . 

In October 1991, IBM participated in the 
formation of the PowerPC Alliance with Apple Computer 
and Motorola (See Section 19.6). IBM wanted to extend 
its workstation RISC microprocessor technology to a 
broader base of personal computers and reduce its 
dependence on Intel. Production of the PowerPC 601 by 
IBM began in late 1993. The PowerPC 603 for portable 
applications was announced in October 1993. 

Intel 

The 80386SL microprocessor was designed for low 
power, small size portable PC systems and was introduced 
in 1990. The chip has a 32-bit internal data path and a 
memory addressability :■ f _ ■: mi a abyie s . ~:~.i 

microprocessor is available at clock frequencies of 20 
and 2 5 MHz. 

The 80486SX microprocessor is similar to the 
80486DX except it does not have an integrated floating- 
point unit. It was introduced in April 1991. The chip 
has a 32-bit internal data path and a memory 
addressability of 4 gigabytes . The microprocessor is 
available at clock frequencies of 16, 20, 25 and 33 MHz. 


14/4 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

The 80486DX2 uses a speed doubling technology and 

was introduced in March 1992. With this technology the 
microprocessor runs at 66 MHz while interfacing to a low 
cost 33 MHz system. This boosted computer performance by 
up to 70 percent without a system redesign. The chip has 
a 32-bit internal data path and a memory addressability 
of 4 gigabytes. The microprocessor is available at clock 
frequencies of 50/66 MHz. 

The OverDrive processors were introduced in 1992, 
as an upgrade strategy for Intel 486 systems. The 
OverDrive processor is based on the "speed doubling" 
technology of the 80486DX2 . It doubles the internal 
speed of the CPU while still "talking" to the rest of 
the system at the same frequency. This boosts overall 
performance by 70 percent. 

March 1993. The name was selected in an employee 
c snipe" it i-:-n and was registered ~c prevent similar 
product designations by competitors. The word Pentium 
contains the syllable pent, which is the Latin root for 
five and is also Intel 's fifth-generation 

microprocessor. It has 3.1 million transistors, nearly 
three times as many as the Intel 486 microprocessor. It 
uses 0.8 micron BiCMOS technology that combines bipolar 
(speed) and CMOS (low power consumption! 

applications five to ten times faster than a 33-MHz 486 
unit. It has a 64-bit data bus and at 66-MHz it has a 
performance of 112 MIPS (Million Instructions Per 
Second) . It utilizes superscalar RISC architecture and 

instructions in a single clock cycle. It also features 
two Level 1 (LI) 8 KB on-chip caches, one for data and 
the other for instructions which improves performance. 
The original Pentium was available at speeds of 60 and 
66 MHz. The price at launch was S878 . This 
microprocessor is now available at speeds from 75 to 200 
MHz. 

Intel introduced the Pentium "P54C" that operated 
at 3.3 volts in 1994. Then Intel introduced the clock- 
tripled 80486DX4 with a larger cache in March. A joint 
venture with Hewlett-Packard to develop a new 64-bit

the IA-64 microprocessor. 

In the fall of 1994, the public became aware of a 
minor design error in the Pentium microprocessor. The 
design flaw which was in the floating point unit, caused 
a mathematical rounding error in a division once every 
nine billion times. Intel had encountered the problem 
several months earlier and had established a policy of 
replacing the chip for those users who were doing a lot 
of mathematical calculations. Then in December it was 
reported that IBM was stopping shipment of all computers 
using ~:".e Pentium. The a::iveu=je publicity resulting from 
this and other reports caused Intel to change its 
replacement policy in late December to include all 
customers, who wanted the Pentium changed. Intel 
scrapped all Pentiums that had not been sold. This and 
the replacement program resulted in a financial loss to 
Intel of $475 million. 

Intel announced the Pentium Pro (initially known 
as the P6| microprocessor in November 19 95 . The Pentium 
Pro contains two chips, a CPU and two sizes of cache in 
a single package. The CPU has 5.5 million transistors. 
The chip incorporated a 16 KB Level 1 (LI) cache. The 
Level 2 (L2) 256K cache has 15.5 million transistors and 
the 512K version has 31 million transistors. The CPU and 

speed bus. The register size is 32 bits, the data bus 64 

bits and the address bus is 32 bits. The microprocessor 

cycle and 300 million instructions per second. Clock 
speeds were 150, 166, ISO and 200 MHz. 

Intel introduced the Pentium processor with MMX 
technology in January 1597. The MMX processor provided 

performance. It also included a 32 KB Level 1 (LI) 
cache. The Pentium II processor was introduced in May 
1997. It extended the power of the Pentium Pro by adding 
MMX technology, dual independent bus architecture and 
was introduced at processing speeds of 233, 266 and 300 
MHz. The chip has 7.5 million transistors. It also 
featured a new single edge contact cartridge physical

In October 1997, Intel announced the new IA-64 

introduction planned for 1999 (subsequently changed to 
2000) . Principals in the joint development with Hewlett- 
Packard were John Crawford of Intel ad Jerry Huck of HP. 

concept of Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing 
(EPIC) . It would also be able to run Windows software 
and HP's version of UNIX. 

The Celeron processor with a clock speed of 266 
MHz was introduced in April 1998. The Celeron is the 
same as the Pentium II, but is mounted in a lower-cost 
module and has no L2 cache. The processor is targeted at 
the low-cost personal computer market. In August Intel 
announced two new versions of the Celeron, the 300A and 
the 333. Both chips had 128 KB of integrated L2 cache 
and the 333 operated at 333 MHz. 

The Pentium II Xeon microprocessor was introduced 
in August 1998. It was designed for mid- and high-range 

operating at 550 MHz in early 1999. A 600 MHz version 
was introduced in August. In October, Intel announced it 
had selected Itanium as the new brand name for the first 
product in its IA-64 family of processors, formerly 
cude-r. ameo Me reed . 

Motorola 

The MC68060 is a 32-bit superscalar 

microprocessor introduced in 1991 . It executes 

instructions at 100 MIPS, has a SK byte instruction 
cache, 8K byte data cache and a floating-point unit. 
Clock speeds are 50-66 MHz. 

Motorola announced the PowerPC 601 mic roproces sor 
in 1992. The new microprocessor was developed through 
the PowerPC Alliance with Apple Computer and IBM (See 
Section 19.6). This is the first implementation of the 
PowerPC family of reduced instruction set computing 
(RISC) microprocessors and is designated MPC601 by 
Motorola. 

The MPC601 is a 32-bit implementation of the 64- 
bit PowerPC architecture. The microprocessor contains 


Hardware in the 1990's 14/7 

2.8 million transistors. It is a superscalar processor 
with the ability to execute three instructions per clock 
cycle. The MPC601 integrates three instruction units: an 
integer unit (IU) , a branch processing unit (BPU) and a 
floating point unit (FPU) . The microprocessor has a 32K 
byte cache and is available in 50 and 66 MHz clock 
speeds. The 50 MHz MPC601 is priced at $380 each and the 
66 MHz version lists at $374 for production volumes of 
20, 000 units. 

In 1994, production began of the PowerPC 603 for 
portable applications, the PowerPC 604 for high 
performance personal computers and the 64-bit PowerPC 

Miscellau eons 

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) successfully 

completed the independent cloned design of the Intel 
80386 microprocessor in August 1990. The new processor 
was named Am386 and was followed by the Am4S6 clone. AMD 
then started development of its own microprocessor 
design using RISC technology that resulted in the 
release of the K5 microprocessor in 1996, to compete 
with the Intel Pentium. The K6 microprocessor followed 
in April 1979 using technology it received after 
acquiring the NexGen company in 1996. AMD announced the 
K6-2 with additional features in May 1998. 

Sun Microsystems released the SuperSPARC 
microprocessor that had 3.1 million transistors in 1991. 
However, the performance was below expectations. It was 
replaced by the successful UltraSPARC microprocessor in 
late 1995. 

Cyrix is a company that got its start by 
producing the 80486SLC chip for notebook computers. 
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) developed the 64-bit 
Alpha 21064 microprocessor in 19 92, that had 1 . 68 
million transistors and operated at 200 MHz. 

MIPS (purchased by Silicon Graphics) introduced 
the R8000 microprocessor in June 1994. It was reported 
to be the world' s fastest microprocessor, a 
supercomputer on a chip. This was followed by the R10000 
chip in 1995.

14.2 ... IBM Computers 


Andy Heller managed the RIOS project that began 

in 1986 to develop a new advanced workstation using RISC 
(Reduced Instruction Set Computing) microprocessor 
technology. John Cocke who created the RISC concept at 
IBM was a principal in the new project. The new computer 
became the RISC System/6000 family of six advanced 
workstations that IBM introduced in February 1990. 

The entry-level systems were called POWERstation 
and POWERserver, and used a POWER architecture. POWER is 
an acronym for Performance Optimization With Enhanced 
RISC. The 32-bit RISC central processing unit (CPU) was 
mounted on a card that plugged into the system 
motherboard. The CPU was available with operating speeds 
between 2 and 3 MHz that enabled 2 8 to 4 million 
instructions per second (MIPS) . the six models varied 
depending on the physical construction, CPU speed, 

version of the IBM Micro Channel (MCA) bus. IBM also 
released an enhanced version of the AIX operating system 
and OSF/Motif software for the workstation. An entry- 
level system with a 20 MHz CPU, 8 MB of RAM, one 1.4 MB 
3.5 inch floppy disk, 120 MB hard disk, a 19 inch 1,280 
by 1,024 pixel monochrome display and other accessories 
had a price of 512, 99 5. The workstations were well 

with other workstation suppliers. 

The PS/1 computer was announced in mid 1990. 

IBM introduced the PS/2 Model P75 portable 
computer in November 1990. The portable computer 
measured 18 by 12 by 6 inches and weighed 22 pounds. A 
standard unit utilized an Intel 486 microprocessor 
operating at 33 MHz, 8 MB of RAM (expandable to 16 MB), 
3.5 inch high-density floppy disk drive and a 160 MB

battery operated PS/2 Model L40 SX laptop computer in 
March 1991. The portable unit measured 12.8 by 2.1 by 
10.7 inches and weighed 7 . 7 pounds. The unit used an 
Intel 80386SX microprocessor operating at 20 MHz and 

2 MB of RAM, expandable to 6 MB. A 3.5 inch 1.44 MB 
floppy disk drive and a 60 MB hard disk drive were 
incorporated into the unit. The display was a 10 inch 
sidelit supertwist VGA LCD that supported 32 gray 
scales. The laptop had an 84 key keyboard and a 17 key 

provided. The base system cost 55,995. 

Ted Selker, who was director of IBM's ergonomics 

California, created the TrackPoint pointing device 
around 1991. It was developed as a means of controlling 
the cursor on the screen without taking the hands off 
the keyboard. The TrackPoint is a small pole mounted on 
the keyboard that converts side pressure to a 
corresponding movement of the cursor. It was one of the 
innovative features of IBM's ThinkPad notebook computer. 

Between 1990 and 1991, IBM started developing a 
pen computing type of computer. The project was headed 
by Kathy Vieth. IBM had done research on handwriting 
recognition and a pen based operating system. However it 
chose a pen based operating system from Go Corporation

that had been founded by Jerry Kaplan . A pel 
computer named ThinkPad was announced in April 19 

In 1992, IBM introduced two low cost se 
computers. The Ambra series was marketed in E 
Canada and France in June, and the Value Point se 
the USA in October. 


14.3 ... Apple Computers 


Sakoman who had headed the Newton project since 1987, 
resigned from Apple in March 1990. Larry Tesler took 
over the project in May. In February 1991, Michael 
Tchao, the product marketing manager, convinced John 
Sculley to concentrate the project on a less-expensive 
handheld version of Newton targeted at the consumer 
market. Sculley envisioned it as a consumer product 
version of the Knowledge Navigator concept he had 
described in his 1987 autobiography Odyssey. Shortly 
after, production of the mini Newton with the code name 
of Junior was approved. Two principals in the product 
development were Steve Capps and Michael Culbert. It 
became a new type of consumer oriented handheld computer 
called a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) . Apple named 
z'-e new pi:sduo- Xe:; sage Pad and launched it in August 
1993. It had a capability to recognize writing by 
writing on its 240 by 336 pixel LCD screen with a 
stylus. It also had an infrared beaming capability for 
intercommunication between computers. The computer used 
an ARM 610 microprocessor designed by Advanced RISC 
Machines (ARM) Ltd. of Cambridge, England. Memory was 4 
MB of ROM and 640 K bytes of RAM. The unit measured 7.25 
inches long by 4.5 inches wide and 0.7 5 inches thick, 
weighed 0.9 pounds and was priced at $699. A number of 
improved models were released later. However, sales were 
significantly below expectations. The Newton product 
line was terminated by Steve Jobs in February 1998. 

The Mac LC was released in 1990. Apple 
discontinued the Apple lie in November 1990. 

In October 1991, Apple participated in the 
formation of the PowerPC Alliance with IBM and Motorola 


Hardware in the 1990's 14/11 

(See Section 19.6). Apple wanted a more powerful 
microprocessor for a new line of Macintosh computers. 

Apple discontinued the Apple II product line in 
November 1993 . 

In 1994, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh 
series of computers in March and the PowerBook 500 
series of notebook computers in May. 

Apple introduced the iMac computer in August 
1998. The computer featured a one-piece blue translucent 

and 15- inch monitor. The system included a translucent 
keyboard and a new round translucent mouse. The unit 
incorporated a 233 MHz PowerPC 750 G3 microprocessor, 32 
MB of SDRAM, 4 GB hard disk drive, 24X CD-ROM drive and 
a 56k modem. A significant omission was that the unit 
did not include a 3.5 inch floppy disk drive. Apple 
priced the computer at $1,299. A completely redesigned 
iMac was introduced in October 1999. 

The iBook is a new portable computer introduced 
in July 1999. It was to be the "iMac to Go' and featured 
a stylish case, large active-matrix display, long 
battery life and a PowerPC G3 microprocessor.

Chapter 15 Software in the 1990's 

15.1 ... Microsoft 

Operating Systems and Windows 

See Appendix B for a description and release dates 
of the different versions of DOS . 

Microsoft released Windows version 3.0 in May 1990 
in New York City with a $10 million promotional 
campaign. This version provided a new file manager, 
networking features, more desktop accessories, new 
screen appearance and new more recognizable icons. It 
was easier to install and provided an easier user 
interface for new users . Within four months a million 
copies were sold. It was a huge success. 

Following the release and success of Windows 3.0, 
Microsoft had additional discussions with IBM in an 
attempt to improve its relationship with the company and 
its participation in the continued development of OS/2. 
In September an agreement was signed that IBM would take 
over most of the OS/2 development, Microsoft would work 
on an advanced future version 3.0 of OS/2 and IBM 
received limited rights to Windows . This resulted in 
Microsoft shifting programmers to Windows development. 
However by April 1991, Microsoft had abandoned OS/2 
completely, and by 1992 the separation was final. 

Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) was a new 
concept introduced into Microsoft products in 1990. It 
was also to be incorporated into a new operating system 
project with the code name of Cairo. Microsoft 
incorporated OLE Version 1.0 technology into PowerPoint 
in the summer of 1990 and to Excel in 1991. 

In May 1991 Microsoft co-sponsored a new Windows 
World Exposition Conference. 

Version 5.0 of MS-DOS was released in June 1991. 
This was an upgrade version only available from 
Microsoft that required a previously installed version 
of MS-DOS. It was a highly successful release. IBM had 
released its own version 5.0 but it had a number of 
problems. The success of the Microsoft products and 


15/1 


15/2 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

other problems resulted in a further deterioration in 
the relationship with IBM during the latter part of 
1991. 

The highly successful Windows Version 3.1 upgrade 
with over 1,000 enhancements that included support for 
Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) and TrueType font 
technology was released in April 1992 . It was in direct 
competition with the IBM release of OS/2 Version 2 in 
March. However the new release of Windows was a huge 
success that resulted in three million copies being 
shipped in the first six weeks after its introduction. 

Microsoft announced Win32 in July 1992. Win32 is 
an application program interface with a 32-bit flat 
memory model, multithreading, preemptive multitasking, 
interprocess communication features and other advanced 
features . 

Windows for Workgroups is a networking program 
with workgroup capabilities that was released as Version 
3.1 in October 1992. It was not successful, and 
improvements were made that resulted in Version 3.11 
being released in November 1993. 

Version 6.0 of MS-DOS was released in March 1993 
and OLE Version 2 . in 1993. 

Windows NT (New Technology) was announced in May 
1993, and the first release was at Version 3.0. Windows 
NT is an advanced operating system for PC computers . It 
is a 32-bit system incorporating Win32 concepts with 
compatibility for applications written for MS DOS, 
Windows, OS/2 and POSIX. Other features included are: 
security protection to U.S. Government C-2 level, 
portability to different microprocessor architectures, 
symmetric multiprocessing support, built-in networking 
capabilities and support for international multilingual 
applications . The system will operate on Intel 
microprocessors, MIPS workstations and supports the DEC 
Alpha architecture. The software requires 12 to 16 
megabytes of memory and a powerful microprocessor such 
as an Intel 486 or better. Windows NT is a sophisticated 
operating system for workstations and file server 
applications . 


Software m the 1 990 ' s 15/3 

In August 1994, the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
office, approved a Microsoft request to register the 
label "Windows" as a trademark. 

Various improvements were made to the Windows NT 
software under the code name of Daytona. The hardware 
requirements were reduced and the system reliability 
improved. This resulted in an upgrade Version 3.5 being 
released in September 1994. 

The Consumer Products Division released what was 
called a new "social interface" with the product name of 
Bob in March 1995. This new easy to use user interface 
requires Windows, a 48 6 microprocessor and 8 megabytes 
of memory. It uses a living room setting metaphor with 
12 "intelligent agents" or "friends" and 8 integrated 
programs. The "room" can be rearranged and customized by 
the user. An intelligent agent can be selected by the 
user to act as a guide through different tasks. The 
agents observe user actions and get to know the user and 
anticipate the persons needs . The eight integrated 
programs provide a calendar, checkbook, letter writer, 
address book, e-mail, financial guide, GeoSafari and 
household manager. The program has a price of $100 and 
received mixed reviews . 

Chicago was the product code name assigned to a 
new advanced 32-bit operating system. It evolved from 
Windows with some MS-DOS code and some features from 
Windows NT. It incorporated Win32 technology and was 
targeted at the mass consumer market. Microsoft released 
an extensive beta test of the new software starting in 
June 1994. Then after a number of delays the software 
was released as Windows 95 in August 1995. The program 
incorporated a new user interface, 255-character file 
names, preemptive multitasking, multithreading, support 
for "plug and play" to optimize hardware performance and 
integrated network connectivity to the new Microsoft 
Network (MSN) . MSN provides on-line communication to 
commercial services and the Internet. Microsoft 
estimated that more than 1 million copies of Windows 95 
were purchased by customers at retail stores during the 
first four days after the release. 

Windows as a separate graphical user interface for 
MS-DOS essentially ended with the release of the Windows 


15/4 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

95 operating system. The functionality of MS-DOS and the 
previous Windows graphic user interface had been 
integrated in the new operating system. 

WINPAD is a new operating system being developed 
for handheld computers . 

Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 was released in 
July 1996. It combined the ease of use of the Windows 
operating system with the reliability and security of 
Windows NT. Windows NT Server is a powerful operating 
system foundation for server applications, such as 
BackOffice, that was released in 1996. 

The Windows CE operating system, is a subset of 
the Windows family that was released in 1997. It was 
developed for a broad range of communications, 
entertainment and mobile devices . 

Windows 98 that had a project name of Memphis was 
released in June 1998. It integrated Internet Explorer 
version 4 and supported numerous new device types. This 
was reported to be the last major version of Windows 
based on the old DOS system. Future versions of Windows 
will be based on NT technology. 

Other Microsoft Product Releases 

Microsoft Office was introduced in 1990. Initially 
it was a discounted suite of applications that consisted 
of Word, Excel and PowerPoint. The applications 
contained in the suit were subseguently changed to 
incorporate a standard user interface and improved 
integration features using Object Linking and Embedding 
(OLE) and Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) technology. 
Version 4.0 of Office was released in October 1993. It 
contained Word 6.0, Excel 5.0 and PowerPoint 4.0, plus 
Mail and Access in the Professional Office edition. 
Office 95 was released with Windows 95 in August 1995, 
Office 97 in January 1997 and Office 2000 in June 1999. 
Microsoft offers various versions of its Office suite 
and has a dominant position in this market. 

Microsoft issues upgrades to its application 
software to add improvements, new features and correct 
problems at one to two year intervals . Excel for 
Windows, Macintosh and OS/2 was improved with the 
release of Version 3.0 in January 1991, Version 4.0 in 


Software m the 1 990 ' s 15/5 

March 1992 and Version 5.0 in October 1993. Word for 
Windows has also been improved with the release of 
Version 1.1 that included a grammar checker in November 
1991, Version 2.0 in 1992 and Version 6.0 in October 
1993. Microsoft moved from Version 2.0 to Version 6.0 to 
synchronize the Word for Windows version number with the 
MS-DOS version number. PowerPoint Version 3.0 shipped in 
May 1993 and Version 4.0 in October 1993. 

Microsoft released Visual Basic for Windows in May 
1991. Visual Basic is a graphical version of BASIC that 
simplifies the writing of programs for Windows . It was 
subseguently released in three editions: Standard, 
Professional and Enterprise. 

Microsoft introduced a personal finance and home 
banking program called Money in 1991. Schedule + is an 
appointment, scheduling and list management program that 
was released in 1992 . 

Microsoft entered the database segment of the 
application software market when it acguired Fox 
Software and its advanced database program called FoxPro 
for $173 million in March 1992. Then in November, 
Microsoft announced its own database program called 
Access at a significant discount to increase market 
penetration. These actions contributed to the financial 
difficulties of Borland International, who was a major 
supplier of database software for the personal computer 
market . 

Microsoft at Work is a software and architecture 
technology for the connection of office eguipment that 
was announced in June 1993. Eguipment such as copiers, 
fax machines, hand-held devices, printers and telephones 
would be able to communicate with a personal computer 
using Windows software. Microsoft released a system for 
fax machines in January 1995. However, it was not 
successful . 

BackOffice is an integrated series of server 
applications that enables users to access information 
from inside and outside an organization. It can be 
combined with a new system called Microsoft Exchange and 
the Office suites. Microsoft Exchange was released in 
beta test in February 1995. It is an extension of

Microsoft Mail and is a groupware type of program that 
was developed to compete with Lotus Notes. 

The company released a final version of Internet 
Explorer 2.0 for Windows 95 in November 1995. Version 
3.0 was released in October 1996, Version 4.0 in 
September 1997 and Version 5.0 in March 1999. 

Multimedia 

The CD-ROM division established in 1985, became 
the multimedia publishing division in March 1992. After 
many delays and changes in project management, the 
encyclopedia with code names of Merlin and finally 
Gandalf shipped with the product name of Encarta in 
March 1993. Encarta now contains a 2 9-volume 
encyclopedia with 26,000 articles, an interactive atlas 
and an illustrated timeline of world history. 

This division has and still is releasing many 
other multimedia CD-ROM products . Some of these are 
Ancient Lands, Art Gallery, Atlas, Cinemania, Complete 
Baseball, Dangerous Creatures, Dinosaurs, Isaac Asimov's 
The Ultimate Robot, Musical Instruments and disks on a 
number of musical composers. 

New Developments 

Microsoft is currently working on a number of 
systems that suggest a convergence of operating systems, 
application software, communication technology, personal 
computers and television. Some of these are the WINPAD 
operating system, TV set-top device software and Tiger 
cable-TV project. The Tiger project is a network server 
system to provide video-on-demand and interactive TV. 

Microsoft' s vision of "Information At Your 
Fingertips," "A Computer on Every Desk and In Every 
Home" and "Windows Everywhere" is becoming a reality.

15.2 ... Apple Computer and IBM 

Apple Computer 

Apple Computer released HyperCard IIGS in January 
1991 and the System 7 operating system for the Macintosh 
computer in May. 

In October 1991, Apple participated in the 
formation of the PowerPC Alliance with IBM and the 
creation of joint software companies called Kaleida to 
develop multimedia applications and Taligent to develop 
an advance operating system (See Section 19.6) . Apple 
wanted to move in a direction that facilitated the 
interaction between their systems and IBM. 

Apple Computer announced a new strategic plan in 
September 1994, that would expand the Macintosh 
technology base. The company had decided to open the 
Macintosh hardware and software by licensing the 
operating system to other computer vendors in January 
1995. This licensing and an agreement with IBM and 
Motorola in November 1994, to create a new common 
hardware reference platform for computers based on the 
PowerPC microprocessor, was intended to increase market 
share. Another part of this overall strategy was to 
offer independent software developers a broader 
installed base to design applications for the Macintosh 
platform. 

In February 1997, the company acguired NeXT 
Software, Inc. Apple obtained the NeXT operating system 
to replace its own future operating system with the code 
name of Copland that had been having technological 
problems. The new operating system based on Apple and 
NeXT software technology would have the code name of 
Rhapsody. Avidis Tevanian, who had been a principal in 
the software design at NeXT was placed in charge of the 
new operating system and became a senior vice president 
for software engineering. 

Apple terminated the program to license the 
Macintosh operating system to other personal computer 
vendors and its support of the unified PowerPC platform 
in September 1997. The company had decided that the 


15/8 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

benefits of increased market share were more than offset 
by the costs of the licensing program. 

A new operating system called OS 8 was released in 
July 1998 . The new system featured multi-threading, 
PowerPC processor-native finder, spring-loaded folders, 
pop-up windows, contextual windows and an Internet Set 
Up Assistant. This was followed by the release of OS 9 
in October 1999 with over fifty new features. Apple 
indicated that it intended to make a new release of the 
operating system each year with a major change on OS X 
(ten) in 2000. 

IBM 

In early 1990, James Cannavino had discussions 
with Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer regarding the 
possibility of Microsoft assuming full responsibility 
for OS/2 development. However the discussions were not 
successful. The release of the highly successful 
Microsoft Windows Version 3.0 in May 1990, had a further 
detrimental effect on OS/2 sales. Then in September IBM 
announced that it was taking over most of the 
responsibility for the development of OS/2. Around this 
time Cannavino appointed Joseph Guglielmi as a senior 
marketing executive for OS/2. 

Cannavino received approval from the Corporate 
Management Committee (CMC) to remove Microsoft from any 
future development of OS/2 in early 1991. This position 
was announced in April, accompanied by a statement that 
a new version of OS/2 would run DOS applications better 
than DOS and Windows applications better than Windows. 
The announcement also stated that IBM would release the 
new version of OS/2 by the end of 1991. Coding in the 
new version was now being changed from assembler to the 
"C" programming language. 

In October 1991, IBM participated in the formation 
of the PowerPC Alliance with Apple Computer and the 
formation of joint venture companies called Kaleida and 
Taligent to develop multimedia applications and an 
advance operating system (See Section 19.6) . IBM wanted 
to share Apple' s expertise in personal computer software 
development and provide an alternative to OS/2 and 
Microsoft systems. 


Software m the 1 990 ' s 15/9 

Problems accommodating Window applications delayed 
the release of OS/2 Version 2.0 to March 1992. It 
included the graphics Presentation Manager user 
interface. The price had been reduced to a low of $35 
for Windows users, $99 for DOS users and $139 for all 
others. However sales of the new Version 2.0 were well 
below expectations. Also affecting sales was the lack of 
application programs from other software companies for 
the new operating system. 

OS/2 Warp Version 3 was released in October 1994. 

15.3 ... Other Software 

Corel 

Corel Corporation introduced new versions of its 
highly successful graphics program CorelDRAW in the 
1990' s. Corel initiated a unigue marketing strategy for 
CorelDRAW by marketing several versions of the program 
simultaneously. Version 2 was introduced in November 
1990, Version 3 in May 1992, Versions 4 and 5 in May 
1993 and May 1994 respectively, then Version 6 in August 
1995. Corel entered the home consumer multimedia CD-ROM 
market in April 1995. Then after the acguisition of the 
WordPerfect and related software in February 1996, the 
company released the Corel WordPerfect suites and 
applications . 

Digital Research 

Digital Research released Version 5.0 of DR-DOS in 
April 1990 followed by Version 6.0 in 1991. Then after 
Digital Research was purchased by Novell, Inc., in 1992, 
DR-DOS became Novell DOS. 

Linux 

Linus Torvalds, a 21-year-old student at Helsinki 
University in Finland, developed an experimental version 
of the UNIX operating system in 1991. Torvalds posted 
the source code on the Internet and named the new 
operating system Linux. This open-source software was 
widely disseminated and improved upon by many users. By 
1992 it was functioning on Intel processors, had a 


15/10 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

graphical user interface and had about 1,000 users. By 
1995, networking capability had been added, the system 
had been modified to run on other processors and now had 
an estimated 500,000 users. In 1998 the number of users 
was estimated to be 7,500,000. 

The dominant commercial supplier of the Linux 
operating system software, is Red Hat Software Inc., 
that was founded in early 1995 by Bob Young and a former 
IBM software engineer named Marc Ewing. The company 
provides manuals, support and other services for the 
Linux operating system. 

Lotus 

Notes is a communications program developed in the 
mid 1980 's by Iris Associates Inc., which was a research 
group that spun off from the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. Raymond Ozzie was a principal in the 
development of the software and president of Iris 
Associates. The software technology was bought by Lotus 
Development Corporation in 1988 and released with the 
name of Lotus Notes in 1990. The software enables the 
connection of multiple personal computers, to share 
databases, files and provides advanced e-mail 
capabilities. It is also called groupware. It 
facilitates collaboration by communication and sharing 
of information between groups of people. This software 
was one of the significant reasons for IBM to purchase 
Lotus Development Corporation in 1995. 

Mosaic 

In 1993, Marc Andreessen a young undergraduate 
student and Eric Bina, developed a graphical browser for 
the World Wide Web (WWW) called Mosaic at the National 
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) located at 
the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of 
Illinois . Mosaic provided a more visual form of WWW 
hypertext presentation, support for images and an 
intuitive user interface for a non-technical user. The 
software was developed for use on a UNIX operating 
system then translated into versions for the Apple 
Macintosh and IBM PC computer platforms. The program was 


Software m the 1990's 15/11 

distributed free over the Internet and received 
widespread use. 

In August 1994, a small company located in 
Illinois, called Spyglass, Inc., that was founded by Tim 
Krauskopf in 1990, obtained the exclusive rights to 
license Mosaic software. 

Netscape 

when James H. Clark was leaving Silicon Graphics 
in January 1994, he told a friend that he wanted to 
start a new high technology company. The friend 
suggested he contact Marc Andreessen, who had just 
graduated from the University of Illinois in December 
1993, where he codeveloped the Mosaic browser. Clark met 
Andreessen and after considering various ventures, Clark 
decided to finance a new company to exploit the 
commercial possibilities of a Mosaic type browser. Clark 
founded Mosaic Communications Corporation in April 1994. 

Andreessen and Clark had recruited the other key 
team members from NCSA that developed Mosaic and a few 
personnel from Silicon Graphics. They then completely 
recreated the Mosaic browser with additional features, 
improved performance and stability for the UNIX, Apple 
Macintosh and PC computer platforms. The company 
released the beta version of the browser they named 
Mosaic Navigator in October 1994. This beta release was 
available free by downloading from the Internet. 

In the fall of 1994, the University of Illinois 
demanded that Clark provide financial compensation for 
using their technology or intellectual property and to 
stop using the name Mosaic. This resulted in the company 
name being changed to Netscape Communications 
Corporation in November. Then to avoid litigation, an 
agreement was reached with the university that provided 
an undisclosed financial settlement in December. The 
first production version 1.0 of the browser was shipped 
in December with a new name, Netscape Navigator. "By 
spring, more than 6 million copies had been downloaded 
by users all over the world" [134 -page 4] . 

James L. Barksdale joined the company as president 
and chief executive officer (CEO) in January 1995 and 
the company went public in August. Other products that 


15/12 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

became popular tools for server and authoring Web data 
were also developed. Navigator 2.0 with integrated e- 
mail was released in September and version 3.0 with 
Internet telephone in April 1996. The Communicator 
Professional with HTML authoring and group calendar was 
released in June 1997. 

Since the founding of the company, Clark had 
misgivings about future competitive actions by 
Microsoft. Between September and December of 1994 there 
was an interchange of communications for Microsoft to 
license the Netscape browser. However, Microsoft decided 
to license Mosaic from Spyglass. In the spring of 1995, 
Clark stated that Microsoft was withholding application 
programming interface (API) information applicable to 
Windows 95 that Netscape reguired for release 2.0 of its 
browser. In June, Microsoft advised that the API's would 
be provided if they could obtain an eguity position and 
a seat on the board of Netscape. Clark rejected the 
offer and obtained legal counsel. This and other 
uncompetitive activities led to the antitrust action 
against Microsoft by the Department of Justice in 1977. 
Clark' s concern for the future viability of Netscape led 
to his consideration of forming an alliance or sale of 
the company in 1997. America Online completed the 
acguistion of Netscape Corporation at a cost of $4.3 
billion in March 1999. 

Novell 

After acguiring Digital Research in 1992, a new 
version of DR-DOS with improved networking capabilities 
was released as Novell DOS 7 in December 1993. Novell, 
Inc., sold its WordPerfect word processing program and 
related suite software to Corel Corporation in January 
1996. Corel paid $10.75 million and 9.95 million shares 
of its common stock for the acguisition. 


Software m the 1 990's 15/13 

Sun 

In 1991, a small research group was created at Sun 
Microsystems that conceived the development of a new 
system for the consumer market. The system would include 
a portable consumer device and an operating system that 
could interact with any other system. James Gosling was 
assigned to develop the operating system that became a 
project code-named Oak. Project Oak evolved into a 
platform-independent programming language and operating 
system for consumer electronic products. In 1994, the 
language design was repositioned so it could be used to 
build interactive applications for the Internet. The 
language was named Java and was introduced in May 1995. 

Java is based on the C and C++ languages that has 
evolved into a general purpose language. It is portable 
to a variety of hardware platforms and operating 
systems. It is supposedly a "write once, run anywhere" 
language. Java is both a programming language and an 
environment for executing Java programs that has 
received wide spread use. This use has been increased by 
Sun posting the language on the Internet for free 
downloading by programmers. The language has also been 
licensed by a number of large companies such as Apple 
Computer, IBM, Microsoft, Netscape and Oracle. 

Microsoft licensed the Java programming language 
technology from Sun in March 1996. Then in October 1997, 
Sun started litigation against Microsoft regarding its 
implementation of the language and the compatibility 
requirements of the license agreement. This action was 
supported by the court with a preliminary injunction 
siding largely with Sun in November 1998 . 

In mid 1998, Sun introduced a sister technology to 
Java called Jini . Jini was developed by a Sun research 
group led by William Joy. Jini enables a digital device 
to be connected into a computer network, identify itself 
and its parameters. It allows for a group of electronic 
devices to collaborate and combine to form a complex 
system. 


15/14 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

WordPerfect 

WordPerfect Corporation introduced DrawPerf ect , a 
business presentation graphics program in February 1990 
and a smaller version of WordPerfect named LetterPerf ect 
in June. In May 1990, the company announced a change in 
emphasis to release a version of WordPerfect for 
Microsoft Windows ahead of a version for the IBM OS/2 
operating system. The company had misjudged the market 
acceptance of OS/2 and Windows. WordPerfect for Windows 
was not released until November 1991 and an OS/2 version 
was delayed until 1993. 

Yahoo! 

David Filo and Jerry Yang were graduate students 
at Stanford University, when they created a web site and 
a free guide to the World Wide Web (WWW) in early 1994. 
The guide began as a list of their favorite Web sites 
and by the summer had tens of thousands visitors daily. 
As the list grew it was broken into a directory of 
search categories, then subcategories. Filo and Yang 
manually designated the categories as compared to 
computer generated indexes being created elsewhere. This 
resulted in an intuitive and a more selective means of 
locating information. 

It was in the summer that they selected the name 
Yahoo! for the search engine. Yahoo! is a whimsical 
acronym for "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle." 
By the fall the number of Yahoo! users had increased 
dramatically, but they had no revenue. 

In the spring of 1995, Filo and Yang approached 
Don Valentine' s venture capital company, Seguoia 
Capital, and obtained $4 million of finance capital for 
Yahoo! Inc. Shortly after they started to hire a 
business team and Timothy Koogle was recruited as 
president and chief executive officer. Koogle guickly 
moved to correct the revenue side of the business that 
resulted in a new look for Yahoo! in August. This 
included the addition of advertising, a major change in 
the hierarchy with a reduction in the top level to 14 
major search categories and the addition of a Reuters 
news service. Other services such as weather information 
and stock guotes were subsequently added. 


Software m the 1 990's 15/15 

In the fall of 1995, a second round of investment 
financing for $40 million was arranged. Two of the 
strategic investors were Reuters and the Softbank 
Corporation. In early 1996, Masayoshi Son of Softbank 
increased his investment in Yahoo! to obtain 
approximately 3 0% ownership. The company went public in 
April 1996 and Filo and Yang each ended up with over 15% 
of the company. Koogle has built Yahoo! into a powerful 
portal for e-commerce. 

15.4... The Road Ahead 

Gates book The Road Ahead, [89] articulates the 
future direction of software and new technology as seen 
by the chairman of the dominant supplier of software for 
personal computers. Terms such as cable-TV, information 
highway, information utilities, intelligent agents, 
interactive TV, multimedia, networks, social interface 
and video on demand all suggest a future direction for 
software development. Programming languages dominated 
the 1970' s, application programs and operating systems 
the 1980' s. The 1990' s is adding significant 
capabilities for communication of information. Research 
to facilitate the use of computer technology will 
provide an extension of the mass consumer market to 
include novice home users . Software will be the 
technology that provides the synthesis to extend 
personal computing.

Chapter 16 Corporate Activities in the 1990's 

Apple Computer 

The company entered the 1990' s under John 
Sculley' s direction with increasing sales and profits. 
However, in the following years the company would 
encounter problems resolving its product strategy. Apple 
could either limit the use of its proprietary technology 
and maintain a high profit margin, or license the 
technology and achieve a greater market share for it. 
This problem was not helped by an executive group with 
individual aspirations that lacked corporate 
cohesiveness . Gilbert Amelio has described the Apple 
organization as a "dysfunctional culture." This affected 
the future performance and even the viability of the 
company. 

Litigation by Xerox regarding the similarity of 
Macintosh graphics systems to the systems developed at 
PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) was thrown out in early 
1990. In March 1991, the Windows /Macintosh graphics 
litigation with Microsoft was found to be in favor of 
Apple Computer, only to have most of it thrown out in 
April 1992. 

In early 1991, Apple began negotiations with IBM 
regarding the possible use of IBM RISC microprocessor 
technology for a more powerful Macintosh computer. This 
resulted in an early announcement to form the PowerPC 
Alliance with IBM and Motorola in July 1991, followed by 
the final agreement in October (See Section 19.6) . 

A significant decline of profits in 1993, resulted 
in John Sculley being replaced by Michael H. Spindler as 
the chief executive officer in June. Sculley became 
chairman of the board. Then in October, Sculley resigned 
from Apple Computer and joined Spectrum Information 
Technologies as chairman and chief executive officer. 

Gilbert F. Amelio, who was the CEO of National 
Semiconductor Corporation, became a member of the Apple 
Computer board in November 1994. 

Due to a continuation of declining profits and 
loss of market share, Gilbert Amelio replaced Spindler 


16/1 


16/2 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

as the chief executive officer in February 1996. The 
company lost $816 million in 1996. 

Apple acquired NeXT Software Inc., for $427 
million in February 1997. The company was purchased to 
obtain the NeXT operating system. Steven Jobs who had 
founded NeXT, became a consultant to the chairman of the 
Apple board. 

In the spring of 1997, Apple Computer announced a 
corporate restructuring and laid off 2,700 employees. 
Then in May, Apple formed an independent subsidiary to 
produce and market the money losing Newton hand-held 
computer . 

Although Amelio had implemented many improvements 
at Apple, the board wanted a new chief executive officer 
who would increase sales. This resulted in the 
resignation of Amelio in July. The company lost $1,045 
million in 1997. Steven Jobs announced in August, that 
Microsoft was investing $150 million in the company. 
Apple agreed to drop its legal dispute about Microsoft 
Windows versus the Apple Macintosh graphic interfaces. 
Apple also agreed to promote the use of Microsoft 
Internet Explorer software on the Macintosh and 
Microsoft agreed to update and release its popular 
Office suite of applications for the Macintosh. 
Significant changes were made to the Apple board of 
directors with resignations that included vice-chairman 
Mike Markkula and the appointments of Lawrence Ellison 
from Oracle Corporation and William Campbell from 
Intuit . 

The company introduced the iMac computer and 
discontinued its Newton MessagePad and eMate product 
lines in 1998. Sales of the discontinued products had 
been significantly below expectations. The company also 
stated that they wanted to focus their efforts on those 
products critical to the future success of the company. 
Apple reported in 1998, that its share of the personal 
computer market had declined to 4.6% in the USA and to 
3 . 6% worldwide . 

The iBook portable computer was introduced in July 
1999. At the end of Apple Computer's 1999 fiscal year in 
September, net sales were $6,134 million and the company 


Corporate Activities in the 1990's 16/3 

had 6,960 regular employees. Steven Jobs was interim 
chief executive officer and a director of the board. 

Apple Computer is a unique company that has 
created an inspired and devoted following. Its easy-to- 
use technology, starting with the Apple II and then the 
Macintosh computer are acclaimed. The company has become 
an icon, an American success story. Conceived by 
entrepreneurs in a garage who became multimillionaires. 
Unfortunately it has lost significant market share in a 
largely IBM compatible market. A lack of consistent 
leadership has been a handicap. Management have allowed 
what was the dominant supplier of personal computers, to 
become a relatively minor participant in the current 
market. If Apple had made the Macintosh operating system 
more open, it may have gained a significantly greater 
share of the market. Its pioneering proprietary 
technology has lost its initial advantage. The future 
for the company is somewhat uncertain. 

Compaq Computer 

In a management reorganization in January 1991, 
Eckhard Pfeiffer who had previously led Compaq 
operations in Germany, was appointed chief operating 
officer. Then in October, the company announced a major 
restructuring of its operations and a reorganization 
into distinct product divisions. Pfeiffer was elected 
president and chief executive officer, replacing co- 
founder Rod Canion. The company had experienced 
unsatisfactory financial results that also resulted in a 
reduction of the number of employees by approximately 14 
percent . 

Compaq became the world' s largest producer of 
personal computers in 1994 and the world' s fifth largest 
computer company in 1995. 

In June 1997, Compaq acquired Tandem Computer Inc. 
for the equivalent of about $4.1 billion in stock. 
Tandem is a manufacturer of fail-safe minicomputers and 
servers for processing online transactions. Also in 
1997, Compaq started to make a transition from "build- 
to-inventory" to a "build-to-order" manufacturing 
environment . 


16/4 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

Compaq announced an agreement to purchase the 
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for $9.1 billion in 
January 1998 . Compaq Computer stated that the merger 
would create the "second largest computing company" in 
the world. The merger was completed in June. 

During 1998, Compaq expanded its direct-sell 
process based on customer build-to-order choice. 

In April 1999, Eckhard Pfeiffer left the company. 
It was reported that Benjamin Rosen and the company's 
board were not satisfied with the profitability of 
company. Michael D. Capellas was appointed the new 
president and chief executive officer in July. 

At the end of Compaq's 1999 fiscal year in 
December, sales were $38.5 billion. Benjamin M. Rosen 
was chairman of the board and Michael Capellas president 
and chief executive officer. 

Dell Computer 

Dell Computer Corporation has become a dominant 
direct sale provider of build-to-order personal 
computers. However, Dell had financial difficulties in 
1993 due to problems with a new laptop computer and an 
overaggressive company expansion. Michael Dell 
reorganized his company and brought in new experienced 
executives from other companies such as Morton L. Topfer 
who left Motorola and joined Dell in June 1994. 

In 1999, the company stated that it was the "the 
second-largest manufacturer and marketer of personal 
computers in the United States and were No. 2 
worldwide." At the end of Dell's fiscal year in 
February 1999, sales were $18.2 billion and the company 
had more than 24,400 employees. Kevin B. Rollins and 
Topfer are vice chairmen and Michael Dell is chairman 
and chief executive officer. 

IBM 

IBM sold its Lexington, Kentucky keyboard, printer 
and typewriter division as an independent company that 
became Lexmark International Group, Inc. in March 1991. 
Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, an investment firm arranged 
the financing. Marvin L. Mann, a former IBM manager 
became the chairman, president and chief executive 


Corporate Activities in the 1990's 16/5 

officer. IBM retained a ten percent share of the new 
company. 

The Lexington division sale helped to minimize a 
loss of $2.8 billion for IBM in 1991. This was the 
beginning of profitability problems for the company 
under the direction of John Akers and Jack Kuehler. In 
late 1991 IBM announced a major reorganization of the 
company from a single centralized company into a group 
of more independent business units . 

In October 1991, IBM participated in the formation 
of the PowerPC Alliance with Apple Computer and Motorola 
to develop a new RISC microprocessor for personal 
computers, software for an advance operating system and 
development of multimedia applications (See Section 
19.6) . 

An intense price war in personal computers, by 
firms such as Dell Computer, Compag Computer and the 
various clone manufacturers, forced IBM to implement an 
extensive cost reduction program in 1992 . This resulted 
in James Cannavino obtaining special reductions for 
corporate overhead from the Corporate Management 
Committee (CMC) . Cannavino then appointed Robert J. 
Corrigan to head the hardware part of the personal 
computer operations. 

In June, IBM formed a separate company known as 
the Individual Computer Products International (ICPI) . 
This company was formed to market a series of low cost 
personal computers in Britain, Canada and France using 
the Ambra brand name. Then in September, James Cannavino 
announced the creation of the IBM Personal Computer 
Company (IBM PC Company) with worldwide responsibility 
for all aspects of the personal computer business. 
Robert Corrigan was appointed president of the new 
company. A new series of low cost computers developed in 
the late summer was introduced in October using the 
ValuePoint brand name. 

In 1992, IBM had a second year of financial 
losses, $5 billion, a new corporate record. 
Reorganizations and staff reductions had not returned 
the company to profitability. IBM also sold Rolm Systems 
in May, a telecommunications subsidiary it had purchased 
for $1.3 billion in 1984. 


16/6 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

In January 1993, the IBM board announced the 
resignation of John Akers as chairman and Jack Kuehler 
as president. Kuehler' s resignation was effective in 
February and Akers in March. The announcement also 
stated that the company' s dividend to shareholders would 
be reduced for the first time, by 55 percent. In April, 
Louis V. Gerstner replaced John Akers as chairman of the 
board and chief executive officer. The position of 
president was left vacant. Gerstner was from RJR Nabisco 
and the first CEO who had not progressed to the top 
through the company. Gerstner started implementing many 
changes and large write-offs to "right-size" the company 
that resulted in a net loss of $8 billion in 1993. 
During 1993, James Cannavino became a senior vice 
president for strategy and development, and Robert 
Corrigan became president of the IBM Personal Computer 
Company. 

Personal computer revenue had been growing, but at 
a slower rate than some of the other competitors. This 
resulted in G. Richard Thoman, a senior vice-president 
and group executive being appointed head of the Personal 
Computer Group in January 198 4. Changes implemented by 
Gerstner, resulted in a financial turnaround for IBM in 
1994, a profit of $3 billion. However, the number of 
employees had gone from a peak of 407,000 in 1986 down 
to 219,800 in 1994. IBM was a significantly different 
organization . 

IBM acguired Lotus Development Corporation for 
$3.2 billion ($2.9 billion in cash) in July 1995. Jim 
Manzi the former chief executive officer of Lotus became 
a vice-president of IBM. Then in October 1995 Manzi 
resigned. During 1995, G. R. Thoman became the chief 
financial officer of IBM, Robert M. Stephenson senior 
vice president and group executive of the Personal 
Systems Group and William E. McCracken general manager, 
sales and service of the IBM PC Company. 

Taligent Inc., was dissolved in December 1995 and 
became an IBM subsidiary. 

At the end of IBM's 1999 fiscal year in December, 
revenue for the year was $87.5 billion and the number of 
employees was 307,401. Louis V. Gerstner was chairman of 
the board and chief executive officer. 


Corporate Activities in the 1990's 16/7 


Intel 

Robert Noyce, co-developer of the integrated 
circuit and co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and 
Intel, died at the relatively young age of 62, in June 
1990. 

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) litigation to obtain 
a license as a second source for the Intel 80386 
microprocessor and allegations of antitrust violations 
continued in the courts during the early 1990' s. In 
February 1992, the court arbitrator awarded license 
rights for the 80386 to AMD. However, Intel appealed the 
court ruling to the State Supreme Court, but lost the 
appeal in 1994. A compromise settlement on all pending 
litigation between AMD an Intel was reached in January 
1995. 

Intel began an end-user marketing campaign in May 
1991, that used an "intei inside" logo. This cooperative 
advertising campaign with eguipment manufacturers, was 
started to emphasize the Intel brand name to personal 
computer consumers . It was also targeted at companies 
like AMD who had developed a clone of the 80386 
microprocessor. This also led to the discontinuation of 
the x8 6 designation for new microprocessors with the 
introduction of the Pentium in 1993. 

The Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) that had 
been developed by Intel, was announced in 1993. This 
technology permitted faster graphics and enhanced 
computer performance. Intel offered royalty-free 
licenses on the PCI patents to other companies to 
promote the new standard. 

With the release of the Pentium in 1993, Intel 
also became a manufacturer of motherboards . This enabled 
Intel to implement new microprocessor releases and 
related chips to small companies at a faster rate 
comparable to the larger personal computer 
manufacturers . 

Intel and Hewlett-Packard announced a joint 
venture to develop a new microprocessor in June 1994. 

The company acguired the outstanding shares of 
Chips and Technologies, Inc., for approximately $430 
million in January 1998 . Intel also purchased the 


16/8 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

semiconductor operations of Digital Equipment 
Corporation for $585 million in May 1998. 

Intel was estimated to have 8 6.7% share of the 
microprocessor market in mid 1998. In June the Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC) file an antitrust complaint 
against Intel. The FTC alleged that Intel used its 
dominant position to withhold technical data and 
threatened to restrict supply of chips to other 
manufacturers who had intellectual disputes with the 
company. 

At the end of Intel's 1999 fiscal year in 
December, the company had revenue of $29.4 billion and 
the number of employees was 70,2 00. Gordon Moore was 
chairman emeritus of the board, Andrew Grove chairman of 
the board and Craig R. Barrett was president and chief 
executive officer. 

Microsoft 

In April 1990, the company appointed Michael R. 
Hallman as president and chief operating officer, to 
replace Jon Shirley who had decided to retire. Hallman 
had been at IBM for 20 years and then as president of 
Boeing Computer Services . Shirley remained on the Board 
and Hallman assumed operational responsibilities in 
June. Brad A. Silverberg also joined the company in 1990 
to head the Windows and MS-DOS group and became a vice 
president of Microsoft. Nathan Myhrvold became a vice 
president responsible for advanced technology and 
business development in 1990. 

In March 1991 arguments on items in the 
Windows /Macintosh graphics litigation were determined in 
favor of Apple. Also in March, it became public that the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was investigating 
Microsoft for possible antitrust violations. The FTC 
actually began the inquiry in June 1990. The Commission 
of the European Communities also launched a similar 
investigation of Microsoft practices, after receiving 
complaints from Novell, Inc. 

Microsoft had another stock split in 1991, a three 
for two issue. By the end of 1991 Bill Gates owned about 
57 million shares or 33 percent of Microsoft. In October 
1992, Forbes magazine reported Gates to be the richest 


Corporate Activities in the 1990's 16/9 

person in North America with an estimated worth of about 
$6.3 billion. 

James Allchin joined Microsoft in 1991 and 
subsequently became a vice president. He is head of the 
business systems division with responsibilities that 
include Windows NT and the advanced Cairo project. 

After less than two years as the president Michael 
Hallman left the company. This resulted in a major 
reorganization of the company into three major groups in 
March 1992. The three groups reporting through a new 
Office of the President, were Products, Sales and 
Support, and Operations. Executive vice president Mike 
Maples had the Products Group, Steve Ballmer as an 
executive vice president, the Sales and Support Group 
and Frank Gaudette was Chief Financial Officer with 
responsibilities for the Operations Group. Craig Mundie 
joined the company in 1992 and became head of the 
advanced consumer division and was appointed a vice 
president of Microsoft. 

In April 1992, the judge favored Microsoft and 
dismissed a significant part of the Apple Computer 
charges that Windows software infringed the "look and 
feel" of the Macintosh graphics system. In August the 
court made additional judgments in favor of Microsoft. 
Then in August 1993 the court dismissed all of Apple 
Computer's remaining infringement claims. 

Then in June 1992, Microsoft announced a major 
agreement with IBM that confirmed their joint 
development separation. IBM relinquished rights to 
Windows NT, but was however allowed to use Windows 
software until September 1993. Microsoft would receive a 
royalty for each copy of OS/2 sold, but paid IBM a one- 
time payment for use of certain IBM patents. 

In 1993 the Federal Trade Commission litigation 
started in 1990, was moved to the Department of Justice 
by the Clinton administration. Richard (Rick) Rashid 
joined the company in 1993 and became head of research 
and a vice president of Microsoft. Rashid was an expert 
in operating systems and chief architect in the 
development of Mach, a UNIX-based operating system. 

Bill Gates married Melinda French, a Microsoft 
product manager on January 1, 1994 on the Hawaiian 


16/10 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

island Lanai . In March 1994, Microsoft reached an 
agreement with Tele-Communications, Inc., to develop an 
interactive cable-TV system for personal computers. This 
is a new entry into the information highway market by 
Microsoft . 

Microsoft lost a patent infringement law suit by 
Stac Electronics in February 1994. The infringement 
pertained to the DoubleSpace disk compression utility 
included in MS-DOS Versions 6.0 and 6.2. Microsoft 
deleted DoubleSpace in Version 6.21 and added DriveSpace 
in Version 6.22 released in June 1994. Also in June, 
Microsoft acguired Softimage, Inc., a leading developer 
of high performance 2-D and 3-D computer animation and 
visualization software. 

Microsoft signed a consent agreement with the 
Department of Justice in August 1994, regarding 
potential antitrust violations. A similar agreement was 
reached with the European Union. However in February 
1995, a Federal judge decided not to ratify the 
agreement. This was successfully appealed by Microsoft 
and the Department of Justice later in 1995. 

Microsoft signed an agreement in October 1994 to 
purchase a company called Intuit, Inc. Intuit had a very 
popular personal finance program called Quicken. However 
after the intervention of the Department of Justice to 
block the merger, Microsoft withdrew its offer to 
purchase the company in May 1995. 

In July 1995, Gates made another major 
reorganization following the retirement of Mike Maples. 
Five senior executives now directed four operating 
groups. Steve Ballmer the Sales and Support Group, 
Robert J. Herbold the Operations Group, and Frank M. 
(Pete) Higgins and Nathan P. Myhrvold directed the 
Applications & Content Group and Paul A. Maritz the 
Platforms Group. 

Microsoft released Windows 95 that previously had 
the code name of Chicago in August 1995. Microsoft also 
provided capability within Windows 95 to access a new 
Microsoft Network (MSN) . In December, Bill Gates 
announced the company' s commitment to supporting and 
enhancing the Internet by integrating its software with 
the public network. Also in December, the company 


Corporate Activities in the 1990's 16/11 

entered into a 50/50 partnership with the NBC television 
network to create a news /information channel and an 
interactive online news service for the Microsoft 
Network (MSN) . 

In January 1996, Microsoft acquired Vermeer 
Technologies Inc., and the FrontPage application 
software. FrontPage is a tool for creating and managing 
Web documents without programming. In February, the 
Interactive Media Division was created with 
responsibilities for applications for children and 
games, the Microsoft Network on line service and 
products of the now-dissolved Consumer Products 
Division. Jeffrey Raikes was promoted to group vice 
president for sales and marketing in July and in 
December the Office of the President was replaced by an 
executive committee. 

In June 1997, Microsoft invested $1 billion in 
Comcast Corporation, the fourth-largest cable television 
operator in the USA. 

WebTV Networks, Inc., was acquired by Microsoft 
for $425 million in August 1997. WebTV Networks was an 
online service that enabled consumers to access the 
Internet through their television via set-top terminals 
using proprietary technologies. 

Microsoft invested $150 million in non voting 
shares of Apple Computer stock in August 1997. Bill 
Gates and Steve Jobs described a broad product and 
technology development agreement between the two 
companies. Microsoft also agreed to develop future 
versions of the popular Office suit of programs for the 
Macintosh computer. 

In October 1997, the Department of Justice 
announced a new investigation of Microsoft. The 
department stated that the company was violating anti- 
competitive licensing practices for personal computer 
manufacturers by tying the use of its Windows 95 
operating system to the use of its Internet Explorer 
software. This investigation, resulted in the launching 
of an antitrust suit by the Department of Justice and 20 
States against Microsoft in May 1998. The antitrust 
trial opened in October, and the number of States was 
reduced to 19 when South Carolina withdrew in December. 


16/12 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

Microsoft released Windows 98 in June. In July, 
Gates appointed Steve Ballmer as president of the 
company. 

At the end of Microsoft's 1999 fiscal year in 
June, net revenue was $19.7 billion. Microsoft is now 
the world's largest software company. 

In September 1999, Microsoft announced it will buy 
the Visio Corporation for $1.3 billion in stock. Visio's 
main software is a graphics package for drawing such 
things as flowcharts, block diagrams and networks. The 
November 29, 1999 issue of Forbes magazine reported Bill 
Gates net worth to be $93 billion, Paul Allen $26 
billion and Steve Ballmer $22 billion. Gates was number 
1, Allen number 2 and Ballmer number 3 on the list of 
the world' s top technological billionaires . 

Novell 

In 1992, Novell acguired Digital Research, Inc. 
from Gary Kildall who died in July 1994. 

Novell acguired the WordPerfect Corporation for 
$1.4 billion in March 1994 and bought the Quattro Pro 
spreadsheet from Borland International for $110 million 
in June. Novell also purchased a license to market the 
Borland Paradox database for $35 million. Novell made 
the acguisitions to gain a greater penetration in the 
business applications market. However, the Novell board 
became unhappy with the acguisitions and forced Raymond 
Noorda to leave. He was replaced by Bob Frankenberg who 
had been at Hewlett-Packard for twenty-five years. 

The company released a suit of applications called 
PerfectOffice in early 1995. 

By October 1995 the WordPerfect contribution to 
Novell sales had declined and was affecting the 
company' s profitability. This resulted in the sale of 
WordPerfect and related suite software to Canadian Corel 
Corporation for $10.75 million and shares of Corel stock 
in February 1996. Corel Corporation was now one of the 
dominant suppliers of software for personal computers. 

The board once again became unhappy with its CEO 
and in late 1996 Frankenberg resigned. He was replaced 
by Eric Schmidt who had been the chief technology 


Corporate Activities in the 1990's 16/13 

officer of Sun Microsystems. Significant reorganization 
and layoffs were made in 1997 to improve profitability. 

Sun 

In early 1990, Sun decided to consolidate its 
computer designs on the SPARC microprocessor technology. 
Its workstations would not use the Motorola 
microprocessor and the 3861 personal computer with the 
Intel microprocessor was discontinued. The SuperSPARC 
microprocessor was released in 1991 to mixed reviews and 
incorporated into Sun's workstations in 1993. The 
Solaris operating system was also introduced in 1993. 

By 1995, Sun was doing very well. The combination 
of computers with a new UltraSPARC microprocessor 
released in 1995 with the Solaris operating system made 
a significant improvement in revenues and more 
importantly profits. Sun had also become a major source 
for powerful servers that powered the Internet. Another 
important event in 1995 with implications for the 
Internet, was the introduction of the Java programming 
language . 

In 1996, Sun acguired a high-end server product 
line from Silicon Graphics . The server had been designed 
by Cray Research using the Sun SPARC microprocessor and 
the Solaris operating system. Sun also considered 
acguiring the Apple Computer company in 1996. However, 
after further consideration it decided not to. 

In late 1997, Sun announced that it would develop 
a version of Solaris operating system for the new Intel 
Merced microprocessor. This would reduce Intel's 
dependence on Microsoft and provide a UNIX operating 
system alternative. 

An entry-level line of workstations called Darwin 
was introduced in January 1988. These low-cost 
workstations sold for under $3000 without a monitor. 

Ed Zander who is the chief operating officer was 
given the additional title of president in April 1999. 
Scott McNealy who relinguished the position of president 
remains the chairman and chief executive officer. 

In August 1999, Sun acguired Star Division, a 
software developer of the StarOffice suit of 
productivity programs. Sun subseguently announced the 


16/14 Part IV 1990's - Current Technology 

development of a version of the suit called StarPortal 
for the World Wide Web. This is intended to provide a 
new method of competing with the highly successful 
Microsoft Office suit of programs. 

Sun, and in particular Scott McNealy has 
contributed to and supported the Department of Justice 
anti-monopolistic litigation against the Microsoft 
Corporation. Sun has become not just a major supplier of 
workstations and computer servers, but also a 
significant innovator in software and a potential threat 
to Microsoft in certain segments of the market. 

Other Companies 

1990 

Jean-Louise Gassee with financial backing from 
AT&T and Seymour Cray founded Be Inc., in 1990. Erich 
Ringewald who had also been at Apple Computer, was the 
director of engineering. The company demonstrated a new 
personal computer called the BeBox in October 1995. The 
computer system price ranged from $1,600 to $3,000. 

In the early 1990' s, the Symantec Corporation 
acquired a number of companies such as the Peter Norton 
Computing company in 1990 and the rival Central Point 
software company. Symantec now focuses its product line 
on communications, networks and is a leading supplier of 
utilities software. 

1991 

Borland International acquired Ashton-Tate and the 
dBASE database application program software for $440 
million in 1991. 

Starting in 1991, the Digital Equipment 
Corporation (DEC) encountered financial losses. This 
resulted in significant staff reductions and company 
reorganization in 1992. However the losses continued and 
resulted in the retirement of co-founder Kenneth Olsen 
in October. He was replaced by Robert B. Palmer who had 
joined DEC in 1985. 


Corporate Activities in the 1990's 16/15 

1992

reorganized and emerged from Chapter 11 protection in 
early 1996. 

1995 

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel, reached a 
compromising settlement in their joint litigation 
regarding AMD's use of Intel technology in January. 

The Zeos personal computer company was purchased 
by Micron Technology in 1995. Joseph and Ward Parkinson 
and Doug Pitman had founded Micron Technology, Inc. in 
1978 as a semiconductor design consulting company. In 
1982, the company started manufacturing semiconductor 
memory chips. The purchase of Zeos resulted in the 
formation of Micron Electronics, Inc. that is now a 
major direct marketer of personal computers. 

In December 1995 the joint venture between Apple 
Computer and IBM to develop an advance operating system 
by Taligent was dissolved. Taligent became an IBM 
subsidiary. 

1996 

silicon Graphics acguired Cray Research, Inc., a 
manufacturer of supercomputers, in February 1996 for 
$161 million. However, it was not a successful 
acguisition and Silicon Graphics announced it was 
selling the remains of Cray Research in March 2000. 

In July 1996, The Atari Corporation was 
terminated. AMD acguired the NexGen company in 1996, 
that had developed advanced microprocessor designs. 

In early 1996, Packard Bell Electronics purchased 
Zenith Data Systems and its personal computer products. 
Then in July, a merger was formed to integrate Packard 
Bell Electronics and the NEC corporation' s worldwide 
personal computer operations outside Japan. The merged 
company became Packard Bell NEC, Inc. Beny Alagem serves 
as chairman, chief executive officer and president of 
the new company. The company is reported to be the 
second largest supplier of personal computers in the USA 
market . 

Since the termination of its computer, the NeXT 
Computer company has concentrated its efforts on 
software development. In early 1996 the company changed

software and service business retained the Hewlett- 
Packard company name. Carleton S. Fiorina became 
president and chief executive officer of the HP computer 
company in July. 

America Online completed its acquisition of 
Netscape Corporation for $4.3 billion in March. The 
acquisition was assisted by a partnership between AOL 
and Sun Microsystems. Sun agreed to buy Netscape 
software and AOL agreed to buy Sun products and support 
the Java programming language. 

In November, Packard Bell NEC announced it was 
closing its USA operations by the end of the year. 
Cheaper competitive products had resulted in financial 
losses and quality problems contributed to the closure.

Chapter 1 7 Hardware and Peripherals 

17.1 ... Memory 

The microprocessor was a significant key to 
lowering the cost of the personal computer. However the 
other key and an egually important one was low-cost 
semiconductor memory. Semiconductor memory started 
replacing magnetic core memory around 1967. 

Their are two types of semiconductor Random Access 
Memory (RAM) . Dynamic RAM (DRAM) reguires periodic 
refresh of the memory contents and Static RAM (SRAM) 
retains the contents without refresh. Both types of RAM 
loose their contents when the power is turned off. Read 
only memory (ROM) retains its contents once it is 
programmed, even when the power is turned off. 

The first commercial IK metal oxide semiconductor 
DRAM was the Intel 1103 released in October 1970. This 
chip had a pivotal role in undercutting the price and 
replacement of core memory. Intel continued to improve 
DRAM capacities with the release of the 4K 2107 chip in 
1972 and the 16K 2117 chip in 1977. However, competitive 
challenges from Japanese companies, would have a 
significant impact on Intel and other North American 
producers of memory chips . 

Japan decided to make a strategic investment in 
the semiconductor memory industry around in the late 
1970' s. The effect of this was the first open market 
release of a 64K DRAM chip by Fujitsu Limited in 1979, 
and introduction of the first 1-megabit DRAM chip by the 
Toshiba Corporation in 1985. A number of other factors 
contributed to the dominance of Japanese manufacturers 
in the 1980' s. Some of these were: a cooperative 
relationship between various companies in the Japanese 
industry, illegal use of U.S. technology, superior 
guality that contributed to lower costs and a 
significant investment in new facilities to produce 
memory chips. This resulted in a price war by the 
Japanese producers to increase their market share 
through the early 1980' s. By 1985 the market situation 


17/3 


17/4 PartV Bits and Bytes 

for North American producers had so deteriorated, that 
the U.S. Government accused Japan of unfair trading 
practices and filed an antidumping complaint against the 
Japanese manufacturers. A semiconductor agreement was 
signed by the governments of Japan and the United States 
in 198 6. However, by this time it had adversely affected 
many U.S. companies such as the Intel Corporation that 
had already decided to withdraw from the DRAM market. 
The company also withdrew from the EPROM chip market in 
1989. 

Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM) 
was invented by Dov Frohman at Intel. The memory 
contents can be programmed then erased by exposing the 
chip to ultraviolet light. Intel released the 2K-bit 
1702 EPROM chip in September 1971. This alterable 
storage medium provided a low cost way to store 
microcomputer programs and became a successful and 
extremely profitable product for Intel until the mid 
1980' s. 

Flash memory was developed by Toshiba. It 
provided the non- volatility of EPROM but the memory 
could be erased electrically. Electrically Erasable 
Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) was developed by 
National Cash Register (NCR) and Westinghouse companies . 

17.2 ... Storage Devices 

Tape Drives 

Paper tape was one of the earliest forms of 
storage for personal computing. However it normally 
required a teletype machine for input/output that was 
too expensive for the average user. 

Another early storage medium for personal 
computers was the magnetic audio cassette tape and the 
subsequent digital data cassette. Information Terminals 
Corporation (ITC) was the first producer of high quality 
data cassettes. The company was founded by J. Reid 
Anderson in April 1969. Anderson had previously 
developed acoustic-coupler modems and a prototype for a 
"smart" computer display terminal. During the 
development of the computer display terminal, Anderson 


Hardware and Peripherals 17/5 

determined that audio tape cassettes were not a 
sufficiently reliable storage medium for recording 
digital data. The audio cassettes did not have a uniform 
magnetic coating or a precise cassette body that 
resulted in "dropouts" or lost data. This resulted in 
the development of a high guality, precision data 
cassette that ITC started producing in 1970. The company 
became the dominant supplier of digital data cassettes 
in the 1970' s. ITC introduced a mini cassette for 
portable data processors and a guarter-inch data 
cartridge in 1975. A new superior coating media for 
tapes and disks named Verbatim, was announced in 
February 1977. The company changed its name to Verbatim 
Corporation in late 1978, and went public in February 
1979. 

The 3M company introduced guarter-inch tape drive 
media in 1971. The capacity of these early drives was 
only 30 megabytes. 

Jerry Ogdin developed the concept of using two 
tones on magnetic tape to represent digital data. This 
was implemented in a Popular Electronics construction 
article with the name of HITS (Hobbyists' Interchange 
Tape System) in September 1975. It was inexpensive and 
was adapted by many manufacturers . Initially each 
company had their own formatting standards. However in 
November 1975 BYTE magazine organized a meeting in 
Kansas City, Missouri of interested companies. The 
companies agreed to a format that became known as the 
"Kansas City Standard." This standard facilitated the 
exchange and use of magnetic tapes on different systems. 

Disk Drives 

The Beginning at IBM 

Hard disk drive technology was developed by IBM 
in the 1950's as described in Section 1.3. The first 
Winchester hard disk drive was announced by IBM in March 
1973 as the Model 3340 Disk Storage Unit. It was 
developed as a low-cost drive for small to intermediate 
computer systems. The term Winchester was used by the 
engineers due to the storage capacity characteristics 
and similarities to the name of a popular rifle as 


17/6 PartV Bits and Bytes 

described in Section 20.4. A principal in the 
development was Kenneth E. Haughton who had assumed 
responsibility for the project in 1969. The drive 
assembly used a removable sealed cartridge with 14-inch 
diameter disks and was available in 35 and 70 megabyte 
storage capacities. 

Floppy disk drives were developed at IBM 
laboratories by David L. Noble during the period of 1967 
to 1971. They were initially developed by IBM as a means 
of storing and shipping microcode for Initial Control 
Program Load (ICPL) software programs on mainframe 
computers. The jacket enclosing the diskette was 
developed to protect the disk during handling and 
shipping. 

The initial eight inch diameter read only units 
had a product designation of 23FD, a code name of Minnow 
and shipped in 1971. The diskette on the read only units 
rotated at 90 revolutions per minute and data was 
recorded on one side only. The diskette capacity was 
81,664 bytes on 32 tracks which were hard sectored with 
eight holes around the outer edge of the disk. 

The eight inch diameter read-write units had a 
product designation of 33FD, a code name of Igar and 
shipped in 1973. The diskette on the read-write drive 
units rotated at 360 revolutions per minute, had a 
capacity of 242,944 bytes on 77 tracks which was 
recorded on one side only and used magnetic soft 
sectoring (no sector holes) . The 33FD diskette drive was 
a success and was used in data entry products which 
started to replace IBM card systems . 

In 1976 the 43FD unit was shipped with data being 
recorded on both sides and capacity increased to 568,320 
bytes on 154 tracks. In 1977 the 53FD double-density 
unit was shipped with capacity increased to 1,212,416 
bytes . 

IBM's research and development activities created 
the Winchester hard disk drives and the floppy disk 
drives. However other companies entered the market to 
compete with IBM products and to provide disk drives for 
other computer systems . Some of these manufacturers were 
Control Data Corporation (CDC), Conner Peripherals, 


Hardware and Peripherals 17/7 

Maxtor, Micropolis Corporation, MiniScribe, Quantum 
Corporation, Seagate Technology, Shugart Associates and 
Western Digital Corporation. In the mid 1970' s, hard 
disk drives were not suitable for use with 
microcomputers due to their large size and high cost. 
However by 1976, inexpensive floppy disk drives became 
available for personal computers. 

Floppy Disk Drives 

Alan F. Shugart joined IBM as a customer engineer 
in 1951. After a number of positions related to memory 
and storage technology he became manager for direct 
access storage products. Shugart left IBM in 1969 to 
become manager of storage products at Memorex. In 1973 
Shugart left Memorex and with Finis F. Connor and Donald 
J. Massaro founded Shugart Associates. The company 
announced the SA-900 8-inch floppy diskette drive that 
retailed for $500 in the summer of 1973. After two years 
Shugart had a dispute regarding capitalization of the 
company and left. Shugart Associates announced the SA- 
400 5.25-inch minifloppy disk drive for $390 in December 
1976. The drive used a single-sided single-density 
floppy disk with a capacity of 110 kilobytes. Shugart 
Associates was acquired by Xerox Corporation in 1977. 
However it was not profitable and resulted in Xerox 
terminating Shugart operations in 1985. 

The first advertisement for a microcomputer 
floppy disk drive in the Byte magazine appeared in the 
August 1976 issue. The eight inch drive is described as 
"iCOM's Frugal Floppy. At $995, your microprocessors 
best friend." It was produced by iCOM Microperipherals 
that was a division of the Pertec Computer Corporation. 
Then in the February 1977 issue of Byte, iCOM advertised 
a 5.25-inch Microfloppy disk drive system for $1,095. 

North Star Computers, was another early 
manufacturer of floppy disk drives for MITS Altair and 
compatible microcomputers. The company advertised the 
Micro-Disk System (MDS) in the January 1977 issue of 
Byte magazine. The unit used a Shugart SA-400 mini 
floppy disk drive and sold for $599 as a kit, or $699 
assembled . 


17/8 PartV Bits and Bytes 

Reference Section 5.5 for information on the 
Apple Disk II floppy disk drive introduced by Apple 
Computer in 1978. In the late 1970' s, other companies 
such as Alps Electric Company of Japan (who supplied 
Apple Computer) , Sony Corporation and Tandon Corporation 
entered the floppy disk drive market. During 1982, 
various Japanese manufacturers offered half-height 5.25 
inch floppy disk drives. 

Microfloppy disk drives were introduced in the 
early 1980' s for portable computers and to provide a 
more durable diskette and a less expensive drive 
assembly. The term floppy was not accurate as the disk 
was contained in a hard-shell cartridge. It also 
included an automatic shutter that closed over the 
recording surface when it was removed from the drive . 
Initially there were different incompatible disk sizes. 
Companies such as Hitachi introduced a 3.0 inch drive, 
Seagate supported a 3.25 inch dive, Sony and Shugart a 
3.5 inch drive, Canon a 3.8 inch drive and IBM a 4.0 
inch drive. This resulted in the Microfloppy Industry 
Committee (MIC) being formed in May 1982 to reach a 
consensus on a common configuration standard. In 
September a 3.5 inch system was proposed. Sony became a 
dominant supplier of 3.5 inch disk drives in 1983. The 
initial Sony disk drive had a storage capacity of 438 
kilobytes that was subseguently increased to 1 megabyte 
(720 kilobytes formatted) . Early applications of the 3.5 
inch drive were in the Hewlett-Packard HP-150 computer 
and the Apple Macintosh computer. 

Hard Disk Drives 

Hard disk drive technology changed significantly 
in the years following its initial development by IBM. 
The storage capacity, access time and physical size have 
been dramatically improved. The original 14-inch 
diameter disk was reduced to 8-inches in 1978, then to 
5.25-inches in 1980, to 3.5-inches in 1984 and to 2.5- 
inches in 1989. 

The first Winchester 8-inch hard disk drive was 
introduced by Shugart Associates in 1978. Alan Shugart 
and Finis F. Conner who had been cofounders of Shugart 
Associates founded Shugart Technology in 1979. A major 


Hardware and Peripherals 17/9 

investment was made in the new company by the Dysan 
Corporation, a disk manufacturer. Shortly after the 
company name was changed to Seagate Technology, Inc. The 
first Winchester 5.25-inch hard disk drive with a 
storage capacity of 10 megabytes was announced in June 
198 0. Conner left Seagate and founded his own disk drive 
company called Conner Peripherals, Inc. in 1985. Seagate 
Technology became a dominant supplier of disk drives 
when it acguired the disk operations of Control Data 
Corporation in 1989. In early 1996, Seagate purchased 
Conner Peripherals and became the largest U.S. 
manufacturer of hard disk drives. 

David Brown, James Patterson and others founded 
the Quantum Corporation in 1980. The companies first 8- 
inch hard disk drive was produced in early 1981 and a 
3.5-inch hard disk drive was introduced in 1988. The 
company is now the second largest manufacturer of hard 
disk drives . 

Western Digital Corporation was founded as a 
manufacturer of calculators and semiconductors in 1970. 
In the mid 1980' s, the company reorganized and changed 
product lines to concentrate on storage devices. The 
company acguired the disk drive operations of Tandon 
Corporation in 1988. Western Digital is now the third 
largest U.S. manufacturer of hard disk drives. 

Apple Computer's first mass storage system called 
the ProFile was introduced in September 1981 for the 
Apple III computer. The unit used Winchester technology, 
had a 5 megabyte storage capacity and was priced at 
$3,495. The hard drive within the ProFile unit was the 
ST-506, a 5.25-inch drive manufactured by Seagate 
Technology. The drive had a built-in power supply and a 
Z-8 based controller. 

Compact Disk 

Compact disk (CD) technology was developed as a 
joint effort by N.V. Philips of the Netherlands and Sony 
Corporation of Japan in 1976. This led to a number of 
specifications to define the disk format standards for 
the various types of media by the early 1980' s (see 
Section 20.3). Compact Disk - Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) 
drives with a capacity of 550 megabytes were introduced 


17/10 PartV Bits and Bytes 

in the USA in the fall of 1984. However with an initial 
price of over $2,000 they were expensive. High price, 
lack of applications and a need for format recording 
standards inhibited the early proliferation of the 
device . 

Bernoulli Drive 

David Bailey and David Norton founded the Iomega 
Corporation in 1980. Iomega introduced the Bernoulli 
removable disk drive with a storage capacity of 44 
megabytes for personal computers in 1983. It is also 
known as a Bernoulli Box and features capacity 
comparable to a hard disk and a removable assembly for 
portability. 

The name Bernoulli is from an eighteenth century 
mathematician Daniel Bernoulli who described the air 
dynamics utilized in the drive. The concept enables an 
extremely close read/write head to disk relationship but 
also a more tolerant protection from drive-head crashes. 

A 100 megabytes Zip drive was introduced in 1995 
and became guite popular as a removable high capacity 
disk storage system. The larger Jaz drive was introduced 
later, but had a number of problems. 

Optical Drives 

The first 12 inch diameter optical drives with 
Write Once, Read Many Times (WORM) recording 
capabilities were introduced in 1983. This was followed 
by 5.25 inch drives that were introduced in 1985. The 
principal feature of the optical drive is its extremely 
large storage capacity, up to 1 gigabyte. The NeXT 
computer was one of the earliest applications of the 
optical disk drive. 


17.3 ... Input/Output Devices 


Prior to the introduction of low cost monitors, 
printers and storage devices the teleprinter was a 
common computer input/output device. The teleprinter had 
an alphanumeric keyboard for input and a character 
printer to produce hardcopy output. It could also 


Hardware and Peripherals 17/11 

include a communications interface, magnetic tape unit 
or a paper tape punch and reader for data storage 
input/output. The teleprinter was often loosely referred 
to as a "Teletype" due to the dominant position of the 
Teletype Corporation in the market. 

The other significant supplier of teleprinters 
was IBM. The market was generally divided between 
Teletype and IBM compatible teleprinters. 

Teletype 

The Teletype Corporation produced many different 
teleprinter models, however popular units included the 
Models 33 and 35 which were announced in 1963. Three 
versions of each model were produced with different 
system designs. The ASR-33 (Automatic Send-Receive) 
version was priced from $755 to $2,000 depending on the 
configuration. The printer speed was 10 characters per 
second. 

For the personal computer user a new machine was 
not only expensive but difficult to obtain. The use of 
used or rebuilt machines at more affordable prices was 
more common. 


17.4 ... Displays 


The September 1972 issue of Electronic Design had 
an article describing how to build a circuit that could 
display 1,024 ASCII characters on a TV set. 

Don Lancaster was an electrical engineer who in 
the late 1960's started writing articles for Popular 
Electronics and Radio-Electronics magazines. One of 
Lancaster's articles described a project on how to build 
a decimal counting unit. Then in the September 1973 
issue of Radio-Electronics Lancaster had an article 
entitled "TV Typewriter" [433] that described how the 
computer could be connected to a television set. A TVT-1 
prototype was built by Lancaster and sold as a kit for 
$120 in 1973. The unit could store up to 1,024 
characters and display 16 lines of 32 characters. The 
unit had text editing capabilities and construction 
details were available for $2 . 


17/12 PartV Bits and Bytes 

The VDM-1 Video Display Terminal was a prototype 
only that was developed by Lee Felsenstein in 1974. It 
was the first video terminal to be used interactively 
with a personal computer. 

In 1972 the IBM 3270 Information Display system 
was announced. This provided improved speed and silence 
of operation. It also facilitated interaction between 
the user and the computer. 

Lear Siegler Inc. (LSI) was an early supplier of 
"glass teletype" terminals after introducing the LSI 
ADM-1 terminal at a price of $1,500. Another major 
supplier of microcomputer monitors was Amdek, founded by 
Go Sugiura in 1977. 

17.5 ... Printers 

Wire Matrix 

The initial development of wire matrix printing 
was by Reynold B. Johnson at IBM. The initial concept 
used a 5 by 7 array of wires to form a character. It was 
introduced with the Type 26 keypunch in 1949. 

In 1954 Burroughs Corporation announced a wire 
printer producing 100 character lines printing at 1000 
lines per minute. In 1955 IBM announced two high speed 
printers capable of printing 1000 lines per minute. 
These high speed wire printers experienced numerous 
problems and were not successful. 

In 1969 IBM introduced the Model 2213 seven-wire 
printer. This printer was unidirectional and printed at 
a rate of 66 characters per second. 

Centronics 

Centronics Data Computer Corporation was founded 
by Robert Howard as a computer systems company. The 
company designed a dot matrix printer called the Model 
101 which was introduced in the spring of 1970. It had a 
speed of 165 CPS (Characters Per Second) using a 5 by 7 
matrix and sold for $2,995. The Micro-1 printer with a 
print speed of 240 CPS and a price of $595 was released 
in 1977. Then in 1979, the company introduced the 
Centronics 700 series that included the Model 779 that 


Hardware and Peripherals 17/13 

was priced at less than $1,000. Centronics was a 
dominant supplier of dot matrix printers in the 1970' s. 

Epson 

Epson was one of the initial developers of low 
cost dot matrix printer technology. Epson's technology 
evolved from a printing device developed to print 
results from Seiko's quartz watch which was introduced 
at the 1964 Olympics in Japan. Subsequently a miniature 
printing device called the EP-101 was marketed by Seiko. 

In 1975 Seiko established a subsidiary which they 
named Epson America, Inc. It was established to market 
and distribute microcomputer products worldwide. The 
name Epson was derived from the "son" of the EP-101 
printer. Initially the company sold component parts to 
original equipment manufacturers (OEM's) who 
manufactured printers under their own brand name. Epson 
released its own dot-matrix printer, the TX-80 in 1978. 
This was the first low cost printer for microcomputers 
and was an immediate success. 

The MX series of printers were introduced in 
1980. This series was sold for the IBM Personal Computer 
under an OEM agreement. Subsequently Epson has developed 
an extensive range of printers using various 
technologies . 

Reference Section 11.7 for Epson computer 
developments . 

IBM 

The IBM ProPrinter was introduced in the spring 
of 1985. It had a speed of 200 CPS, NLQ (Near Letter 
Quality) and was priced at $549. 

Other Printers and Developments 

In the late 1970 's additional wires were added to 
the printhead to improve the resolution of dot matrix 
printers. The early 7-wire heads were changed to include 
9, 12, 14, 18 and by the early 1980 's the 24-wire head 
was introduced. These improvements have provided what is 
called "Near Letter Quality" (NLQ) and "Letter Quality" 
(LQ) printed output. 


17/14 PartV Bits and Bytes 

Color dot matrix printers became available in 
the late 1970' s. A four color ribbon was used with 
overprinting to obtain various colors . 

C.Itoh Electronics (CIE) , Inc. was established in 
December of 1973. It was an early supplier of low cost 
printers for personal computers. A low cost, 80-column 
desktop printer was developed in June 1976. The Apple 
Computer company marketed the C.Itoh printer under the 
name of ImageWriter. Apple introduced the ImageWriter in 
December 1983 at a price of $675. 

In the 1980 ' s many other companies started 
competing in the low cost dot matrix printer market. 
Some of these were NEC, Okidata and TEC. Currently there 
is a rapid shift in the market to move from wire matrix 
printers to ink jet and laser type printers. This is due 
to the noise, print guality and print speed of the wire 
matrix printer. Also the decreasing cost of ink jet and 
laser printers is a significant factor. 

Ink Jet 

Ink jet printing technology has evolved from a 
long history of development. However during the 
1960/70 ' s research and development accelerated. In 1976 
IBM introduced the Model 6640 continuous ink jet printer 
which set new standards for print guality. 

Canon Inc., a Japanese camera company founded in 
the 1930' s, introduced what they called "Bubble Jet" 
concept of printing in 1978. Then starting in 1978 
Hewlett-Packard developed a thermal drop-on-demand 
concept of printing. Color printing capabilities were 
introduced in the 1980 's. 

Hewlett-Packard 

The ThinkJet printer was introduced by Hewlett- 
Packard in 1984. The printer used a disposable printhead 
with twelve individually controlled chambers that 
expelled drops of ink from the nozzle. The printer had a 
speed of 150 CPS with a 11 by 12 dot character and a 
resolution of 96 dots per inch. The printer ink had some 
limitations on the type of paper that could be used. The 
price of the ThinkJet printer was $495. 


Hardware and Peripherals 17/15 

Laser 

Laser printing technology evolved from Chester 
Charlson's electrophotographic inventions in 1938. It 
was further developed as a copying technology at Haloid 
Corporation which became Xerox Corporation in 1961. 

Electrophotographic printing is a complex process 
involving six steps: Charge of a photoconductor (PC) 
surface, exposure of the PC surface to a light pattern 
of the print image, movement of the toner to the 
appropriately charged areas of the PC surface, transfer 
of the developed image to a sheet of paper, fusing the 
transferred image to the paper and finally cleaning the 
PC surface in preparation for the next printing. Most 
electrophotographic printers use either a gas or diode 
laser printhead to scan the PC surface. Typical 
resolutions for laser printers are from 240 to over 800 
dots per inch. 

The first laser printer was developed by Gary 
Starkweather at Xerox PARC in 1971. Starkweather 
modified a Xerox 7000 copier and named the machine 
"SLOT," an acronym for Scanned Laser Output Terminal. 
The digital control system and character generator for 
the printer were developed by Butler Lampson and Ronald 
Rider in 1972. The combined efforts resulted in a 
printer named EARS (Ethernet, Alto, Research character 
generator, Scanned laser output terminal) . The EARS 
printer was used with the Alto computer system network 
and subseguently became the Xerox 9700 laser printing 
system. 

An inexpensive laser printer was introduced by 
Canon in 1983. The Canon LPB-CX had a resolution of 300 
by 300 dots per inch and a operator changeable 
disposable cartridge. The Canon engine was sold to 
Hewlett-Packard and Apple Computer. The engine includes 
the laser diode, lens and mirror system, photosensitive 
roller, toner cartridge and paper handler. The Hewlett- 
Packard printer was named the HP LaserJet and was priced 
at $2,500. The Apple Computer printer was named the 
LaserWriter and was priced at $6,000. Hewlett-Packard 
subseguently became a dominant supplier of laser 
printers . 


17/16 PartV Bits and Bytes 

Burrell Smith was a principal in the development 
of the Apple LaserWriter printer. The printer was 
developed for the Macintosh computer and included a 
Motorola MC68020 microprocessor. The LaserWriter Plus 
was introduced in January 198 6 and the LaserWriter II 
family of printers in January 1988. 

Thermal Printers 

The concept of thermal printing was developed 
during the 1960/70 's using special sensitive paper. 
Thermal wax transfer printers were introduced by 
Brother, Toshiba and others in 1982. A resistive ribbon 
thermal transfer printer was introduced by IBM in 1983. 

17.6 ... Peripheral Cards 

Manufacturers developed many peripheral or add-on 
cards for various personal computers. These add-on cards 
extended and enhanced personal computer capabilities 
beyond those envisioned by the computer manufacturers . 
The following is representative of some of the more 
significant cards . 

Creative Technology 

Sim Wong Hoo, Chay Kwong Soon and Ng Kai Wa 
founded the Singapore company Creative Technology Ltd., 
in 1981. The company started by producing Apple II and 
IBM PC clones. Subseguently the focus was changed from 
clones to peripherals with the introduction of the Sound 
Blaster audio card in 198 9. The company is a world 
leader in the manufacture of sound cards and multimedia 
accessories. Creative Labs, Inc., is a wholly-owned U.S. 
subsidiary and Creative Technology became a public 
company in 1992 . 

Crontemco Inc. 

Cromemco was founded by two Stanford University 
professors, Harry Garland and Roger Melen in 1975. The 
first product was an add-on board called "Bytesaver" for 
the MITS Altair 8800 microcomputer. The board had a 2704 
EPROM memory chip that could be programmed to load a 
monitor program to simplify the startup or "booting" of 


Hardware and Peripherals 17/17 

the computer. A kit cost $195 or $295 assembled. The 
second board produced by Cromemco was called the "TV 
Dazzler" and enabled the microcomputer to be connected 
to a color television set. The board provided a 128-by- 
128 pixel display. A software program called 
Kaleidoscope provided an impressive demonstration of the 
board capabilities. A kit cost $215 or $350 assembled. 
In October 1976 the company released a Zilog Z-80 board 
for the MITS Altair 8800 microcomputer. The Z-80 
microprocessor was faster and had more extensive 
instruction set. The Z-80 board cost $195 as a kit or 
$295 assembled. 

Microsoft 

Microsoft conceived the concept of an add-on card 
that would enable their software to run on an Apple II 
computer. The Apple II computer used a 6502 
microprocessor, but most of Microsoft's software had 
been developed for the Intel series of microprocessors 
and the CP/M operating system. With the increasing sales 
of Apple II computers, this segment of the software 
market was growing. 

Microsoft had Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer 
Products develop what became the Z-80 SoftCard. 
Microsoft announced the Z-80 SoftCard with a price of 
$399 in March 1980. Included with the card was the CP/M 
operating system from Digital Research and two versions 
of BASIC: MBASIC (which was compatible with Microsoft 
BASIC-80) and GBASIC with high resolution graphic 
enhancements. The card was an immediate success. 

The RamCard was released around 1981/82 for the 
Apple II Plus computer to extend the memory by 16K to 
64K bytes. This additional memory allowed the computer 
to run CP/M applications that reguired 64K bytes. 

Processor Technology 

Processor Technology Corporation was founded by 
Robert Marsh and Gary Ingram in April 1975. The first 
product was a 4K static RAM memory expansion board for 
the MITS Altair 8800 microcomputer. This computer only 
had 25 6 bytes of memory in the standard unit and the 4K 
memory board produced by MITS was not reliable. The 


17/18 PartV Bits and Bytes 

memory board was first advertised at the Homebrew 
Computer Club in April 1975 and the first order was from 
Cromemco. It cost $218 as a kit or $280 assembled. A 2K 
memory board was also available. The company also made 
other boards for the S-100 bus such as a 2K ROM Board, a 
3P+S (parallel/serial) board, VDM-1 (Video Display 
Module) board designed by Lee Felsenstein and an 
improved motherboard for the Altair 8800. 

Seattle Computer Products 

Rod Brock owned Seattle Computer Products, Inc., 
that supplied memory cards for the S-100 bus computers 
around 1978. In late 1978 Tim Paterson, an employee of 
the company started developing a card using the new 
Intel 8086 microprocessor. The first prototype card was 
completed in May 1979. It was then demonstrated using 
the new Microsoft 8086 BASIC interpreter at the June 
1979 National Computer Conference in New York City. 
Production units shipped in November 1979. 

Tim Paterson also developed the operating system 
called QDOS for the CPU card in 1980 (see Section 13.1). 
This operating system later became MS-DOS. 

Other Early Manufacturers 

Robert Metcalfe, Greg Shaw and Howard Charney 
founded 3Com Corporation in 1979. 3Com is an acronym for 
the three corn's in computer, communication and 
compatibility. The company's main product is 
communication interface hardware for computer networks . 
Metcalfe had previously been a principal in the 
development of the Ethernet communications software at 
Xerox PARC. 3Com became a public company in 198 4, and 
acquired U.S. Robotics Corporation in 1997. 

Applied Engineering released the Transwarp

acquired by the 3Com Corporation in 1997. 

Dennis C. Hayes and partner Dale Heatherington 
founded D.C. Hayes Associates Inc., in January of 1978. 
The company name changed later to the Hayes 
Microcomputer Products Inc., then to the Hayes 
Corporation. Although modems were common in the business 
world, Hayes was an early commercial developer of modems 
for microcomputers. Hayes introduced the 80-103A Data 
Communications Adapter modem for professional and hobby 
communicators in April 1978 . The unit was priced at 
$49.95 for a bare board and $279.95 assembled. The 
Micromodem 100 was introduced for S-100 bus 
microcomputers in 1979. It could transmit data at 110 to 
300 bbs and had a price of $399. In mid 1981 the

1982 for use with the VIC computer. An interface program 
named VICTERM was included with the unit . The modem was 
priced at only $109.95 and included free offers from 
CompuServe, Dow Jones News and The Source. 

17.8 ... Miscellaneous 

Bus Systems 

A bus system is a set of hardware connections 
used for power, signal and data transfer between 
components of a computer system. The bus system is 
characterized by its size, such as 8-bit or 16-bit and 
the number of lines or connection points . One of the 
earliest bus systems for a personal computer was the 
Altair Bus developed by MITS, Inc., for the Altair 8800 
in January 1975. Other manufacturers adapted this bus 
and it became known as the S-10 Bus. 

Subsequently the IEEE established a standard for 
the S-100 Bus. Then a working group of the IEEE Computer 


Hardware and Peripherals 17/21 

Society developed the IEEE 696 bus standard. It is an 
augmentation and extension of the S-100 bus to 16 bits 

Southwest Technical Products Corporation (SwTPC) 
developed the SS-50 bus for the SwTPC 6800 Computer 
System that they released in November 1975. It was used 
by a number of other manufacturers in computers using 
the Motorola 6800 microprocessor, such as the Smoke 
Signal Broadcasting Chieftain and the Gimix Ghost. 

The release of the IBM Personal Computer in 
August 1981 established another new bus standard, the PC 
Bus. This was an 8-bit bus with 62 connection lines. IBM 
then added additional connection lines to the bus with 
the release of the 16-bit AT computer in August 1984. 
The AT Bus subseguently became known as the Industry 
Standard Architecture (ISA) bus. 

Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) is a proprietary 
32-bit multitasking bus architecture of IBM. It was a 
design feature of the Personal System/2 (PS/2) family of 
computers that were released by IBM in April 1987. 

The Extended Industry Standard Architecture 
(EISA) was developed by a consortium of nine companies: 
AST Research, Compag, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, NEC, 
Olivetti, Tandy, Wyse and Zenith and was announced in 
September 1988. It was developed as an alternative to 
the IBM MCA (Micro Channel Architecture) bus used on the 
PS/2 computers and provided some of the MCA features. 
EISA has a 32-bit data path and maintained compatibility 
with the earlier ISA architecture. 

NuBus is a high-performance expansion bus used in 
the Apple Macintosh computer that was developed at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) . SCSI (Small 
Computer System Interface) that is pronounced "scuzzi," 
is an input output bus that provides a high-speed 
interface for connecting personal computers to 
peripheral devices. The VL Bus is a design established 
by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) in 
1992.

Digitizers 

The first digitizer was called the Bit Pad with a 
11-inch active area and was advertised by the 
Summagraphics Corporation in November 1977. The unit had 
a price of $555 . 

Floppy Disks 

Development of the floppy disk drive by IBM in 
1971, created a reguirement for floppy disks. 
Significant suppliers of floppy-disks were 3M, Dysan, 
Elephant, IBM, ITC (later Verbatim) , Maxell, Memorex, 
Sony and Xidex. 

Information Terminals Corporation (ITC), a 
dominant supplier of digital data cassettes, obtained a 
license from IBM to manufacture 8-inch floppy disks in 
June 1973. The company produced its first floppy disks 
in December and became a dominant supplier of floppy 
disks. ITC collaborated with Shugart Associates to 
provide disks for the new 5.25-inch disk drive 
introduced in December 1976. The single-sided, single- 
density disks had a storage capacity of 180 kilobytes. 
Then in July 1978, ITC introduced a 720 kilobyte double- 
sided, double-density disk. The company name changed to 
Verbatim Corporation in 1978. Between 1979 and 1980 
Verbatim had severe and costly guality problems . A 
license was obtained from the Sony Corporation to 
manufacture 3.5-inch diameter hard plastic case 
microdisks in the spring of 1983. Verbatim also 
introduced a high-density minidisk with a storage 
capacity of 1.2 megabytes in 1983 and increased it to 
1.44 megabytes in 198 6. 

Between 1984 and 1985, Verbatim started 
encountering significant financial difficulties due to 
increasing competition and falling prices for disks. 
This resulted in the company being purchased by the 
Eastman Kodak company in June 1985 for $175 million. But 
by 1990, Kodak was also having problems and sold 
Verbatim to Mitsubishi Kasei, a large diversified 
Japanese company in May. Mitsubishi Kasei changed its 
name to Mitsubishi Chemical Company in October 1984. 
Verbatim is still a dominant supplier in the floppy disk 
market .

Keyboards 

An article entitled "A Short History of the 
Keyboard" in the November 1982 issue of Byte magazine 
describes variations in keyboard layouts. 

Another article entitled "Keyboard Karma" in 
DIGITAL DELI [190, pages 267-269] describes the problems 
the Japanese have with keyboards. 

Microsoft introduced a new ergonomic Natural 
Keyboard in 1994. 

Mouse 

The mouse concept was invented by Douglas C. 
Engelbart at the Stanford Research Institute in 1964. 
Roger Bates and William K. English assisted in the 
development. The first public demonstration was at the 
ACM/IEEE Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 
1968. Engelbart ' s mouse was an analog device with a 
wooden housing that contained a button (subseguently 
three buttons) and wheels that rotated two 
potentiometers. The potentiometers converted the 
movement of the mouse on a surface into electrical 
signals that controlled the position of the cursor on a 
terminal screen. The buttons were used for selection and 
to enter commands . 

A digital wheeled type of mouse was developed by 
Jack Hawley for the Alto research computer at the Xerox 
PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) in 1972. Also at PARC 
in 1972, Ronald Rider developed the ball type of mouse 
that was subseguently changed by Hawley to improve its 
operation . 

The first commercial implementations were on the 
Xerox Star in 1981, and on the Apple Lisa and Macintosh 
computers in 1983 and 1984 respectively. The Xerox Star 
digital mouse used two buttons for control purposes. 
Apple Computer designed a new digital mouse for the Lisa 
computer that used a rubber ball with optical scanners 
to detect motion and one button for control purposes. A 
degree of controversy exists regarding the number of 
buttons to include on a mouse. Human factor studies to 
determine the simplest operation, tend to favor a two 
button mouse. 


17/24 PartV Bits and Bytes 

A company called Mouse Systems introduced the 
first commercial mouse for the IBM Personal Computer in 
1982. It was a three-button mouse. 

Microsoft introduced a mouse with an add-on card 
for the IBM Personal Computer and a mouse for any MS-DOS 
computer using the serial port in May 1983 (see Section 
12.1) . It was priced at $195 with interface software. A 
new design resembling a bar of soap was released in 
September 1987. In late 1996, Microsoft announced the 
Intellimouse priced at $85. The principal new feature of 
the Intellimouse was an additional miniature wheel 
located between the left and right buttons that could be 
used for scrolling in application programs. 


Chapter 18 Magazines and Newsletters 

18.1... The Beginning 

Publication of personal computing articles was 
initially in electronic magazines such as Popular 
Electronics , QST and Radio-Electronics . Then came the 
magazines and newsletters devoted to personal computing 
and microcomputers. Most of these initial publications 
were not specific to a particular microprocessor or type 
of microcomputer. The following are some of the more 
significant publications . 

The first publication devoted to personal 
computing was the Amateur Computer Society ACS 
Newsletter. The editor was Stephen B. Gray who was also 
the founder of ACS. The first issue was published in 
August 1966 and the last in December 1976. It was a bi- 
monthly directed at anyone interested in building and 
operating a personal computer. The newsletter was a 
significant source of information on the design and 
construction of a computer during the time period it was 
published. 

The PCC Newsletter was published by Robert L. 
Albrecht of the People's Computer Company in California. 
The first issue was published in October 1972. The first 
issue cover stated it "is a newspaper... about having 
fun with computers, learning how to use computers, how 
to buy a minicomputer for yourself your school and books 
films and tools of the future." The newspaper name 
changed to the People' s Conputers with a magazine type 
of format in May- June 1911. 

Hal Singer started the Mlcro-8 Newsletter in 
September 1974. This was a newsletter published by the

Green lost publishing control of BYTE, then his former 
wife sold the magazine to McGraw-Hill, Inc. in 1979. The 
publication is oriented as a technical magazine for 
personal computer technology, hardware and software. 
Byte magazine has made a significant contribution to the 
personal computer industry. Unfortunately, the editor 
advised in July 1998 that "This is the last issue of

Chapter 19 Other Companies, Organizations 
and People 

19.1 — Early Organizations 

Amateur Computer Society (ACS) 

Was formed in May 1966 by Stephen B. Gray. It was 
created as "a nonprofit group open to anyone interested 
in building and operating a digital computer that will 
at least perform automatic multiplication and division, 
or is of a comparable complexity." A publication 
entitled ACS Newsletter started in August 1966. Grey has 
stated that "ACS membership never totaled more than a 
few hundred." The newsletter and the Society terminated 
in December 1976. 

People's Computer Company (PCC) 

Robert L. Albrecht founded the People's Computer 
Company and associated Community Computer Center in the 
late 1960's. The company published the PCC Newsletter 
starting in October 1972. The cover of the first 
newsletter stated the "People' s Computer Center is a 
place. ...a place to do things the People's Computer 
Company talks about. ...a place to play with computers - 
at modest prices. ... a place to learn how to use 
computers." It also indicated that "We have a small, 
friendly computer ...an Edu System 20, a time sharing 
terminal that connects us to the world and a Tektronix 
programmable calculator and some simple calculators and 
books to help you learn and ..." 

Community Memory 

Lee Felsenstein who belonged to a group called 
Resource One, helped to organize Community Memory, a 
public information network in the early 1970' s. 
Felsenstein established the organization and system to 
humanize the computer interface and bring computing 
power to the people. It provided free access to a time 
sharing system. The Community Memory system consisted of 
remote teletype terminals located in several storefronts 


19/1 


19/2 PartV Bits and Bytes 

located around Berkeley, California. The system operated 
a bulletin board and enabled people to communicate or 
leave messages. Felsenstein also wanted to replace the 
Teletype units with an easy-to-use machine he called 
"The Tom Swift Terminal." 

Homebrew Computer Club 

At a number of locations in early 1975 in the 
Silicon Valley area, a notice was posted reading 
"Amateur Computer Users Group. Homebrew Computer Club... 
you name it. Are you building your own computer? 
Terminal? TV Typewriter? I/O Device? or some other 
digital black box? Or are you buying time on a time- 
sharing service? If so you might like to come to a 
meeting of people with like-minded interests . " The 
notice had been posted by Fred Moore and Gordon French. 
French was a mechanical engineer and computer hobbyist 
and both had been associated with Robert Albrecht of the 
People's Computer Company. The meeting was held at 
Gordon French's garage in Menlo Park, California on the 
5th of March 1975. About thirty people attended the 
first meeting. Albrecht demonstrated the new Altair 
computer. Another computer enthusiast Steve Dompier 
described his visit to MITS Inc., in Albuguergue, New 
Mexico. Stephen Wozniak also attended this first 
meeting. From this first meeting the Homebrew Computer 
Club was formed. The attendance guickly increased and 
meetings became fortnightly gatherings at the Stanford 
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) . 

The club was a forum for the interchange of 
information and became a catalyst for the technological 
development of the microcomputer. Gordon French was the 
secretary and librarian. Fred Moore issued the initial 
newsletters highlighting the meeting activities and 
other news. A dominant member was Lee Felsenstein who 
became moderator of the meetings . A number of members of 
the club became entrepreneurs who established their own 
companies. Some of these were, Steve Jobs and Stephen 
Wozniak who founded Apple Computer, Robert Marsh founder 
of Processor Technology. Adam Osborne sold his books on 
microprocessors at the club and Felsenstein would design 
the SOL and Osborne microcomputers . 


Other Companies, Organizations and People 19/3 

By 1979/80 the Homebrew Computer Club was past its 
peak with other user groups being formed with a focus on 
more specific interests. 

Other Early Groups 

The Amateur Computer Group of New Jersey was 
founded in May 1975 with Sol Libes as the first 
President. Then the Long Island Computer Association of 
New York formed in 1975. The Southern California 
Computer Society (SCCS) began a few months after the 
Homebrew Computer Club in 1975. It was a well organized 
group which guickly grew and had a membership in the 
thousands. The editor of their magazine left to publish 
his own Interface Age periodical. In 1911 , Jonathan 
Rotenberg who was 13 years old at the time, founded the 
Boston Computer Society in 1977. a special interest 
group called SIGPC on personal computing was formed by 
the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) . The first 
chairperson for ACM SIGPC was Portia Isaacson. 

Many other computer clubs were formed during the 
mid 1970' s in the USA and other countries. Two Byte 
magazine articles : "A Computer Hobbyist Club Survey" 
[477] and "Clubs and Newsletters Directory" [478] 
provide additional details of these early organizations. 

Clubs, groups and societies helped to disseminate 
information on personal computers and computing. 
However, other early organizations that provided similar 
input came in various names such as conventions, fairs, 
festivals and shows.

1973. COMDEX is an acronym for COMputer Dealers' 
Exposition. The show is oriented to computer 
manufacturers , dealers and distributors . The first show 
was held in December 1979. COMDEX has become one of the 
largest computer shows in the world. It holds two major 
shows a year. In winter the show is in Las Vegas and in 
the spring it is in another major city such as Atlanta, 
Chicago or Toronto. 

COMDEX was purchased in 1995 by the Softbank 
Corporation, a large Japanese software distribution 
company. A subsidiary named Softbank COMDEX Inc., now 
operates the COMDEX shows. 

Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 

A show for wholesalers and retailers of consumer 
electronic products. It is held twice a year. Las Vegas 
in January and Chicago in June.

It is the largest annual computer show in the data 
processing industry and is sponsored by the American 
Federation of Information Processing Societies (AFIPS) . 
The first national show was held in New York in June 
1973. Personal computing was recognized as a special 
theme by having a Personal Computer Fair and Exposition 
at the June 1977 conference in Dallas, Texas. Following 
this, microcomputer products became a significant group 
of the exhibitors. 

Other Shows 

The first MacWorld Expo was held in Boston in 
August 1985. CeBIT is one of the largest technology 
expositions in the world, and is held annually in 
Hanover, Germany.

19.4 — Retailers and Software Distributors 

Arrowhead Computer Co. —The Computer Store 

This was the first personal computer store and was 
founded by Dick Heiser in West Los Angeles, California 
in July 1975. He was a dealer for Altair microcomputers. 

Byte Shop's 

Paul Terrell became the MITS Altair 8800 
representative for Northern California in 1975 and 
founded Byte Shop's in December. The Byte Shop store 
opened in Mountain View, California and by 197 6 he had 
76 retail stores around the country. Terrell gave Steve 
Jobs an order for 50 Apple I microcomputer boards in 
April 1976. This led eventually to the founding of Apple 
Computer . 

CompUSA 

Mike Henochowicz and Errol Jacobson founded a 
software store called Soft Warehouse Inc., in 1984. The 
company then started opening superstores and selling 
computer hardware. In 1991, the company went public and 
changed its name to CompUSA Inc. The two founders left 
around this time. James F. Halpin became president and 
chief executive officer of what is now the largest 
personal computer products retailer in the USA. In 1998, 
the company started providing custom-built personal 
computers and purchased the Computer City chain of 
stores from Tandy. 

Computer Mart 

Computer Mart was the first computer retail store 
in New York and was founded by Stanley Veit in February 
1976. Computer Mart sold Apple Computer, IMSAI , 
Processor Technology Sol, SwTPC and other computers. It 
also had a large selection of magazines and books. 


Other Companies, Organizations and People 19/11 

Subsequently a number of other stores opened in other 
parts of the USA with the same name, but different 
owners. They had an informal association then a company 
called XYZ Corporation was formed to enable consolidated 
purchasing and coordinate assistance. However changing 
market conditions resulted in the store closing in 1979. 

ComputerLand 

William H. Millard founded Computer Shack in 
September 1976 and the first president was Edward Faber. 
The company franchised personal computer retail stores 
which at the beginning emphasized the IMSAI 8080 
microcomputer. However due to threatened litigation by 
Tandy Corporation for encroaching on the Radio Shack 
trade name, the name was changed to ComputerLand in 
early 1977. 

The first franchised store opened in February 1977 
in Morristown, New Jersey. By 1984 it was an 
international chain of approximately 700 franchised 
computer stores. 

However in 1984 litigation over a convertible loan 
to IMS Associates (a holding company for ComputerLand) 
resulted in Millard losing 20 percent of the ownership. 
Millard then relinquished control of ComputerLand and 
moved to the Pacific island of Saipan in the spring of 
1986. 

However by 1994 ComputerLand had financial 
problems. This resulted in the franchise and 
distribution portions of ComputerLand being sold to the 
Merisel, Inc., for close to $100 million. Merisel is a 
dominant distributor of hardware and software. 

Computer Store 

This was a retail computer store organization 
founded by Dick Brown and Sid Harrigan in 1975. It had 
the entire USA East Coast distribution rights for Altair 
microcomputers 

Lifeboat Associates 

Lifeboat Associates was founded by Larry Alcoff 
and Tony Gold. The company became a major distributor of 
software in the late 1970 's. One of the early major 


19/12 PartV Bits and Bytes 

products was the CP/M operating system. They also 
developed modified versions of CP/M for North Star 
Computers and other floppy disk drive systems. After the 
release of the IBM PC computer the company also became a 
distributor for Microsoft MS DOS. Lifeboat renamed the 
operating system SB-86 (Software Bus 86) . 

Merisel 

Robert Sherwin Leff started a software 
distribution company called Robwin in April 1980. Robwin 
is a contraction of Left's first and middle names. In 
the summer of that year he formed a partnership with 
David Wagman and in January 1981 the company name was 
changed to Softsel Computer Products . Softsel became one 
of the world' s largest distributors of personal computer 
software during the 1980' s. The company acguired 
Microamerica in 1990, a major hardware distributor, and 
changed the corporate name to Merisel, Inc. 

Personal Software 

Dan Fylstra and Peter Jennings founded Personal 
Software, Inc. in February 1978. The company started 
initially by marketing a game developed by Jennings 
called Microchess and other game programs. Personal 
Software marketed personal computer software in a manner 
similar to book publishers. He would acguire the rights 
of software from the developer and add sophisticated 
marketing and distribution. A significant agreement in 
1979, was for the distribution rights for VisiCalc as 
developed by Daniel Bricklin and Robert Frankston of 
Software Arts. The Personal Software company name was 
changed to VisiCorp in early 1982. 

Software Plus 

Was founded by George Tate and Hal Lashlee in 1980 
as a discount mail-order software service. 


Other Companies, Organizations and People 19/13 

19.5 — Networks and Services 

Networks 

CIENet 

The concept of the CIE (Community Information 
Exchange) Net was introduced by Mike Wilber at the First 
West Coast Computer Faire in April 1977. Wilber proposed 
this early telecommunications network for personal 
computer users, as a means of exchanging programs and 
files of data. 

Ethernet 

A short local area network developed at the Xerox 
PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) for the Alto research 
computer in late 1973. Two of the principals in the 
development were Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs . It is 
a multi-access broadcast system used to link many 
computer systems with a single coaxial cable. The 
control of access is by a system called CSMA/CD (Carrier 
Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) . Xerox 
released Ethernet for use outside the corporation in 
1979. 

Internet 

The Internet evolved from the U.S. Government 
ARPANET as described in Section 2.6 and a sister network 
funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for 
academic purposes, called the NSFnet. U.S. Government 
funding was terminated for the ARPANET in 1989 and for 
the NSFnet in April 1995. This resulted in the emergence 
of commercial networks that became loosely known as the 
Internet . 

Internet is a global network of more than 34,000 
smaller networks, public and private. The number of 
users worldwide was estimated to be 304 million by the 
U.S. Department of Commerce in March 2000. The network 
uses the TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol/Interface 
Program) software specifications. TCP/IP was developed 
by the U.S. Department of Defense for communications 
between computers. 


19/14 PartV Bits and Bytes 


ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) 

ISDN was introduced in the mid 1980 's to combine 
voice and data with about 2 times the throughput. 

PCNET 

After the West Coast Computer Faire in April 1911, 
Dave Caulkins organized a group to design a net which 
became known as PCNET (Personal Computer NETwork) . 

UseNet 

UseNet (for "Users network") is a collection of 
UNIX systems that is a public forum for the exchange of 
ideas and news articles. A group for computer historians 
worldwide is accessed by: alt . folklore . coirputers . 

World Wide Web 

Tim Berners-Lee started developing the concepts 
for the World Wide Web (WWW) for application to the 
Internet at CERN in Switzerland, in 198 9. CERN is an 
acronym for Conceil Europeen pour la Researche 
Nucleaire, (the international council which started the 
laboratory) . CERN is now known as the European Particle 
Physics Laboratory. He had previously developed a 
personal hypertext program called Enquire in 1980. The 
World Wide Web evolved from a desire to link in a 
hypertext manner similar to the capabilities of his 
Enquire program, information resources at CERN and other 
laboratories around the world. The information resources 
included graphics, sound, text and video. Berners-Lee 
designed the hypertext markup language (HTML) for 
encoding documents, the hypertext transfer protocol 
(HTTP) and the universal resource locator (URL) for 
addressing documents (the WWW. whatever system) . This 
became the basis for a global hypertext system that 
Berners-Lee named the World Wide Web (WWW) . 

The WWW program was released to a limited number 
of NeXT computer users at CERN in March 1991 and for 
NeXT users outside CERN in August. The program was then 
converted for other computer users and demonstrated in 
San Antonio, Texas in December 1991. This resulted in an 


Other Companies, Organizations and People 19/15 

increasing number of users during 1992 and the following 
years . 

On-line Services 

America Online 

Stephen M. Case first got involved with an on-line 
service for Atari games in 1983, at a company called 
Control Video Corporation. The company started to 
encounter financial difficulties in 1984. This resulted 
in Case and entrepreneur James V. Kimsey obtaining 
control of the company and changing its name to Quantum 
Computer Services in 1985. Quantum arranged distribution 
and marketing agreements with Apple Computer, Commodore, 
IBM and Tandy to bundle Quantum' s on-line service called 
Q-Link with their computers. In 1989, the company 
introduced a new service called America Online. Then in 
October 1991, the company changed its name to America 
Online (AOL) , Inc., and went public in March 1992 with 
187,000 subscribers. By 1997, AOL had more than 8 
million subscribers and had become a dominant on-line 
service . 

In September 1997, AOL and a telephone company 
called WorldCom, signed a three-way agreement. This 
resulted in WorldCom purchasing CompuServe, an exchange 
whereby AOL obtained the 2 to 3 million CompuServe 
subscribers and WorldCom obtained AOL' s Internet 
division, and AOL committed to a long-term phone pact 
with WorldCom. AOL is now the largest on-line service 
provider with about 14 million subscribers . 

AOL acguired Netscape Communications Corporation 
for $4.2 billion in November 1998. AOL also signed at 
the same time, a licensing and marketing agreement with 
Sun Microsystems Inc. The company wanted to dramatically 
step up its Web presence by using Netscape's Web sites 
and software. 

CompuServe 

Jeffrey Wilkins founded CompuServe Corporation as 
a computer service to an insurance company in 1970. 
Wilkins expanded the company into a computer time 
sharing service to provide personal computer users 


19/16 PartV Bits and Bytes 

access to large data banks of information in 1978 . This 
new service was named MicroNET. It also became a popular 
means whereby computer users could exchange information 
via bulletin boards. 

The company was acguired by H & R Block Inc., and 
the service name changed from MicroNET to CompuServe 
Information Services in 1980. The company provided a 
diverse range of services which included: bulletin 
board, business data, computer technology information, 
educational reference, electronic mall shopping, 
entertainment, home and health, money markets, news and 
weather, sports and travel. 

By 1997, CompuServe was encountering difficulties 
and was losing market share to companies such as America 
Online and Microsoft. This resulted in the company being 
sold to WorldCom in September. 

Delphi 

General Videotex Corporation started an on-line 
service named Delphi in 1982. To expand the service. 
General Videotex purchased the Byte magazine BIX (Byte 
Information Exchange) on-line service in January 1992. 

Dow Jones News/Retrieval 

The Dow Jones News/Retrieval service was provided

standard independent of AT&T. It was a reaction to the 
alliance formed in April 198 8 between AT&T and Sun 
Microsystems to develop a unified UNIX system. 

Since the release of UNIX in 1969, many different 
versions of the operating system had been developed by 
various organizations. The different versions had unique 
characteristics that affected the portability of the 
operating system and inhibited the development of 
application software.

Early Books 

Coirputer Lib and Dream Machines [2 04] was a book 
authored and self -published by Theodor H. Nelson in 
1974. It was part of a grass-roots, anti-establishment, 
computer-power-to-the-people movement in California in 
the early 1970' s. Other organizations related to this 
movement were the People's Computer Company and 
Community Memory. 

An Introduction to Microcoraputers [44] was 
another early influential book. It was written and self- 
published by Adam Osborne. It provided a practical 
introduction to microprocessors. 

Knowledge Navigators 

Knowledge navigators evolved from the Vannevar 
Bush future Memex machine, Douglas C. Engelbart' s 
augmentation of man's intellect concepts, Alan Kay's 
Dynabook concept and Theodor Nelson's hypertext ideas. 

Theodor H. Nelson described a "unified system for 
complex data management and display" called Xanadu in 
his 1974 book Coirputer Lib and Dream Machines . Nelson 
also proposed a hypertext text manipulation system. 

In 1987, John Sculley proposed "a wonderful 
fantasy machine called the Knowledge Navigator ..." in 
his book Odyssey [73] . Sculley described it as a tool to 
"drive through libraries, museums, databases, or 
institutional archives." This would enable an individual 
to convert "vast guantities of information into 
personalized and understandable knowledge." 

Another term used by Bill Gates in his book [89] 
The Road Ahead is "spatial navigation." Gates used the 
term to describe the process of navigating on the 
information highway.

CD-ROM and Multimedia applications 

Multimedia is a technology that can integrate 
text, graphics and sound in a single document. The use 
of multimedia in personal computers received significant 
impetus from the development of CD-ROM technology in the 
mid 1980's (see Section 20.3). 

Two of the earliest companies to develop CD-ROM 
applications were Cytation and the Activenture 
Corporation. The early developments were text only. Gary 
Kildall of Digital Research, also founded Activenture 
Corporation in 198 4 and renamed the company KnowledgeSet 
Corporation in 1985. Activenture developed a CD-ROM disk 
based on the Academic American Encyclopedia that was 
offered by Grolier in 1985. Tom Lopez founded the 
Cytation company in late 1984 and developed a CD-ROM 
disk called CD-Write that incorporated reference texts. 
The Cytation company was purchased by Microsoft 
Corporation in January 198 6. These early developments 
evolved to include multimedia products by companies such 
as Microsoft (see Sections 12.6 and 15.1) . 

Other Items 

Stephen Wozniak created the mythical Zaltair 
microcomputer for the First West Coast Computer Faire in 
April 1977. Wozniak did it as a prank against the 
established MITS Altair computer. He printed twenty 
thousand brochures describing an "incredible dream

20.4 ... Terminology: Clarification and Origins 

Bit 

The first documented use of the term "Bit" was in 
an internal memo by John W. Tuckey at the AT&T Bell 
Laboratories in January 1947. It was used in a table 
defining terms to describe an individual character in 
the binary system. 

The first use of the term bit in a publication 
was by Claude E. Shannon in the Bell System Technical 
Journal, July 1948 issue. Shannon used the term bit to 
describe a binary digit in a measuring system related to 
a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon stated 
that it was "a word suggested by J. W. Tuckey". 

Bug 

The first use of the term "Bug" in computer 
technology is attributed to Grace Murray Hopper during 
the summer of 1945. During the development of the 
Harvard Mark II computer an operational failure was 
caused by a moth getting in one of the computer relays . 
Subsequently when determining an operational problem it 
would on occasion be described as "debugging the 
computer" . 

There has been some question as to the origin of 
the problem on the Mark II computer in 1945. Also Fred 
R. Shapiro has shown in a Commentary of the April 1994 
issue of BYTE magazine that the terms "bug" and 
"debugging" had usage prior to 1945. 

Byte 

The first use of the term "Byte" was on the IBM 
Stretch computer development in an internal memo written 
in June of 1956. Initially it referred to any number of 
parallel bits from one to six. Shortly after August 1956 
the Stretch computer design was changed to incorporate 
8-bit bytes . 

The first published reference using the term byte 
was in the IRE Transactions on Electronic Coirputers , 
June 1959 issue. It was stated by W. Buchholz that "The 


Miscellaneous Items 20/7 

term is coined from bite, but respelled to avoid 
accidental mutation to bit" . 

Hypertext 

Theodore H. Nelson is attributed as being the 
originator of the term hypertext. Nelson described it as 
"non-seguential writing -- text that branches and allows 
choices to the reader, " non-seguential information 
retrieval and perusal. It is related to his Xanadu text 
manipulation system. 

Microcomputer 

Gilbert Hyatt stated in an article "Micro, Micro: 
Who made the Micro ?" [328] that "I trademarked the name 
microcomputer" in 1968. 

Microprocessor 

In an article entitled "A History of 
Microprocessor Development at Intel" [342], Robert N. 
Noyce and Marcian E. Hoff stated that "The term 
"Microprocessor," first came into use at Intel in 1972." 
Prior to the development of LSI computer chips the term 
"microprocessor" referred to a processor of a 
microprogrammed computer. 

Minicomputer 

The origin of the term minicomputer is attributed 
to John Leng of Digital Eguipment Corporation (DEC) . 
Leng was responsible for establishing a DEC presence in 
the United Kingdom in the mid 1960's. In reporting sales 
activity he stated that "Here is the latest minicomputer 
activity in the land of miniskirts as I drive around in 
my Mini Minor." The term then became used at DEC and 
throughout the industry. 

Personal Computer 

Competing claims have been made in two 
periodicals. An IEEE Computer magazine article states 
that "Kay and others . . . coined the term "personal 
computer" at Xerox PARC in 1973." BYTE magazine claims 
to have "coined the term, in our May 1976 issue."

Portable Computer 

The term portable computer requires clarification 
because of the way it has evolved into different forms 
or categories over the years. Generally it is a computer 
that can be carried by an individual from place to 
place. Initially it could only be operated from an AC 
power source, today it is battery operated. The 
following are the different designations for the various 
types of portable computers : 

The transportable computer, also known as a 
luggable , is the earliest form of a portable computer. 
It weighed fifteen pounds or more and generally ran off 
an AC power source. The IBM 5100, announced in 1975, is 
the first commercially produced portable computer 
(weighed 50 pounds) . The Osborne and Compaq portable 
computers released in 1981 and 1982 are other examples 
of this type. 

The laptop computer weighing around seven to 
fourteen pounds, that could be placed on a persons lap 
was the next stage in portable computing. It could be 
operated from a battery or an AC power source. It is 
also a generic name used by the press for today' s 
lighter notebook computers. The GRiD Compass that was 
introduced in 1982 is an example of the laptop type of 
portable 

The notebook computer is the current popular 
portable computer and typically weighs between five to 
eight pounds. The physical size is similar to a paper 
notebook, with approximate dimensions of nine by twelve 
by two inches. Of increasing popularity are the "light 
and thin" versions with a weight of less than five 
pounds and a thickness of less than 1.5 inches. The NEC 
UltraLite introduced in 1989 is an early example of this 
type of portable. 

Other variations of even lighter portables are 
known as the Ultraportable with a standard keyboard, and 
the Subnotebook weighing four pounds or less with a 
smaller keyboard and screen. 

The tablet is a portable type of computer that 
does not have a keyboard and uses a pen or stylus for 
input. The GRiDPad portable announced in 198 9 is an 
early example of this type. 


Miscellaneous Items 20/9 


Silicon Valley 

The term "Silicon Valley" has been attributed to 
Don Hoeffler, who was a journalist for Electronic News. 
Hoeffler used the term to refer to the region of Santa 
Clara Valley, south of Stanford University in a series 
of articles in January 1971. 

Vaporware 

The term "Vaporware" came into vogue during 
1983/84 to describe software that was announced, highly 
publicized, long awaited but still not available. Some 
of this may have been attributed to the Microsoft 
announcement, prolonged development and delayed release 
of Windows software. The term was first coined by the 
Inf eWorld publication. 

Winchester (hard drive) 

The term "Winchester" was an early internal code 
name for a sealed hard disk developed by IBM between 
1969 and 1973. It was derived from a disk storage unit 
development that had two spindles, each with a disk 
capacity of 30 megabytes. The unit was initially called 
"30 - 30" and because of the similar designation to a 
popular rifle from the Winchester Company it became 
known as the Winchester hard drive. 

fVintel 

A long-standing relationship between Microsoft 
and Intel resulted in the term "Wintel"." It refers to 
Microsoft Widows running on an Intel microprocessor.

Blank page 


Computers/Business 


This book is an exciting history of the personal computer 
revolution. Early personal computing, the "first" personal 
computer, mvention of the microprocessor at Intel and the first 
microcomputer are detailed. It also traces the evolution of the 
personal computer fioni the hardware and software hacker, to its 
use as a consumer appliance on the Internet. This is the only book 
that provides such comprehensive coverage. It not only describes 
the hardware and software, but also the companies and people who 
made it happen. 

Hardware from the MITS Altair to the IBM Personal 
Computer and the Apple Macintosh are covered. Separate chapters 
describe the developments at sigmficant compames such as Apple 
Computer and IBM. Successful companies such as Compaq and 
Dell and the less successfiil ones such as Commodore and Osborne 
are also detailed. 

Details of tlie software tliat powered the haidwaie ate 
described. This mcludes application programs, operatmg systems, 
and programming languages. Two chapters describe the founding 
of Microsoft by BiU Gates and Paul Allen and the major 
contributions by tlie company to tlie personal computer industry. 

The development of components such as disk drives, 
memory, modems, printers and video terminals are included. 
Associations, clubs, conventions and the numerous magazines that 
supported the industry are also chronicled. 

The most extensive bibliography on tlie histoiy of tlie 
personal computer industry and a complete index make tlie book a 
valuable reference source. 

Finally share tiie excitement of tiie mcredible success and 
fortunes created by people such as Michael Dell, Bill Gates and 
Steve Jobs.

Chapter 2 Personal Computing in the 1960's 


Most mainframe computers used a sequential batch 
process type of operation for computing tasks at the end 
of the 1950's. This mode of operation resulted in a slow 
and cumbersome interaction with the user. 

The 1960's was a decade that saw many improvements 
to personalize the computer user interface. The 
government funded research in organizations such as the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the 
Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) by the 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the 
Department of Defense. This resulted in innovations of 
significant importance for personal computing. 
Educational institutions such as MIT, Dartmouth College 
and Stanford Research Institute (SRI) created items such 
as the first personal computer, the "mouse," computer 
networks, BASIC programming language and time sharing. 

2.1 ... Time sharing 

A time sharing computer system is one that 
interacts with many simultaneous users through a number 
of remote consoles. An interleaving in time of two or 
more jobs on one processor gives what appears to each 
user, as the dedicated use of the computer. The first 
paper published describing time sharing was by 
Christopher Strachey at the Paris International 
Conference on Information Processing in June 1959. 

MIT developed and tested the concepts of time 
sharing between December 1958 and early 1959 on an IBM 
704 computer. Principals in this early development were 
John S. McCarthy, an early advocate of time sharing and 
Herbert M. Teager. 

A Study Group investigated MIT's computational 
requirements for research and teaching in 1960 and made 
recommendations in early 1961. This resulted in the 


2/3 


2/4 Part 1 The Historical Background 

development of a time sharing system for an IBM 709 
computer by Fernando J. Corbato and his staff that was 
first demonstrated in November 1961. This group 
developed the system further on an IBM 7090 computer and 
it became known as the Compatible Time Sharing System 
(CTSS) . MIT presented a paper describing CTSS at the San 
Francisco Spring Joint Computer Conference in May 1962. 

Jack B. Dennis wrote a proposal for a time sharing 
system on the MIT TX-0 computer in 1959. Then in 1961, 
MIT received a Digital Eguipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 
minicomputer. Under the direction of Dennis, a graduate 
student John E. Yates developed a time sharing system 
for the DEC PDP-1 that became operational in the spring 
of 1963. 

Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., (BB&N) in Cambridge, 
developed another time sharing system for the DEC PDP-1 
in 1962. Two of the principals in the development were 
J.C.R. Licklider and John McCarthy. BB&N presented a 
paper entitled "A Time-Sharing Debugging System for a 
Small Computer" describing these developments at the 
Spring Joint Computer Conference of 1963. 

The Advanced Research Products Agency (ARPA) 
appointed J.C.R. Licklider in 1962 to be in charge of 
the new Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). 
Convinced that time sharing would be an important 
computer technology, Licklider selected Robert M. Fano 
at MIT to head the development of a major new system. 
This new time sharing system became known as Project MAC 
(Multiple-Access Computer or Machine-Aided Cognition) 
and an early version was operational by November 1963. 
Initially it could serve 24 users simultaneously. In 
less than a year it was serving 200 users with 100 
teletypewriter terminals. Improvements made to the 
system throughout the 1960 ' s resulted in it becoming an 
important node in the ARPANET. 

In late 1963 the Project MAC Group began a search 
for a more suitable time sharing computer. This resulted 
in the selection of the General Electric GE-645 computer 
in 1964. Shortly after, General Electric and Bell 
Telephone Laboratories joined MIT in the development of 
a new comprehensive time sharing system. This new system 
became known as Multics (Multiplexed Information and 


Personal Computing in the 1960's 2/5 

Computing Service) . It became operational at MIT in 
October 1969, and within two years was serving 500 
users . 

These early developments of time sharing 
technology were important in providing personal 
computing capabilities in a more friendly interactive 
mode at lower cost to an increasing number of users. 
Other institutions such as Dartmouth College started to 
evaluate these new concepts. 

2.2 ... Dartmouth DTSS and BASIC 

Between 1956 and 1962, a small university called 
Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, started 
developing simple high-level programming languages on a 
small LGP-30 computer. Principals in these developments 
were John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz. Kemeny and 
Kurtz had a conviction that, "...knowledge about 
computers and computing must become an essential part of 
a liberal education." To implement this objective and 
achieve acceptance by the students they had to simplify 
both the computer interface and the programming language 
used by the students. 

Existing languages such as FORTRAN and ALGOL were 
too complex for the majority of students. The early 
languages developed at Dartmouth were: DARSIMCO 
(DARtmouth SIMlified COde) , DART, ALGOL 30, SCALP (Self 
Contained ALgol Processor) and DOPE {Dartmouth 
Oversimplified Programming Experiment) . During this 
period Kurtz became aware of time sharing technology at 
MIT and BB&N. To meet their computer educational 
objectives they decided to develop and implement a new 
time sharing system and a new simple programming 
language for interactive computing. 

In 1963, Dartmouth College selected a new hardware 
system consisting of a General Electric (GE) GE-225 
computer for user programs, a GE Datanet-30 computer for 
communications and scheduling, a disk drive and other 
peripherals. Kurtz supervised undergraduate students in 
the development of the time sharing software, 


2/6 Part 1 The Historical Background 

emphasizing simplicity of use for the novice. This 
software became known as the Dartmouth Time Sharing 
System (DTSS) . At the same time Kemeny developed a 
compiler for the simple high-level programming language 
they had designed, named Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic 
Instruction Code (BASIC) . Features incorporated in the 
BASIC programming language were influenced by the 
knowledge and experience of using ALGOL, FORTRAN and the 
early languages developed at Dartmouth. The College 
received the new computer system equipment in February 
1964 (the GE-225 computer was changed to a GE-235 in the 
summer) . The new time sharing system, BASIC compiler and 
the first test programs operated successfully on May 1, 
1964. Subsequently, the College put the programming 
language in the public domain in order to improve its 
widespread acceptance . 

Between 1964 and 1965, Dartmouth College began an 
association with GE that resulted in a joint effort to 
develop a time sharing system and a BASIC compiler for a 
new GE-635 computer. The College developed the BASIC 
compiler that became known as GE-BASIC. GE became a 
significant contributor in the dissemination of the 
BASIC programming language on larger computers. Other 
companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) 
and Hewlett-Packard (HP) developed interpreter 
implementations of BASIC for smaller computers in the 
late 1960's. 

The Dartmouth College development of a simple time 
sharing system and the BASIC programming language made a 
significant contribution to personal computing in the 
mid 1960's and following years. Continued improvements 
to the language were made with the release of versions 
two to five between 1965 and 1968. All implementations 
of BASIC at Dartmouth College have been compilers, 
whereas most of the later implementations on small 
personal computers were interpreters. Time sharing 
became widespread and BASIC became a popular programming 
language for personal computing. 

However for intensive computational applications, 
time sharing could not provide the processor resources 
required. Also the convenience and flexibility of having 


Personal Computing in the 1960's 2/7 

one's own dedicated processor led to the development of 
the personal computer. 

2.3 ... The First Personal Computer 

To avoid confusion, one has to define the term 
"personal computer" as being a computer designed for use 
by one person. In the 1960's most computers were large 
mainframes, shared by many users. 

A number of people consider the MIT LINC to be the 
first personal computer. The Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) developed LINC to facilitate the use of 
computer technology in biomedical research laboratories. 
LINC is an acronym for Laboratory INstrument Computer. 
Principal designers were Wesley A. Clark and Charles E. 
Molnar . MIT demonstrated a prototype in March 1962 at 
the Lincoln Laboratory and completed sixteen units in 
mid 1963. The scientific users assembled the units to 
improve their understanding of the system that cost 
about $32,000. Initial software was a text editor, an 
assembler and some utilities. 

The LINC system had four console modules, an 
electronics cabinet and a keyboard. The electronics 
cabinet was about the size of a refrigerator. The 
processor logic circuits used transistorized system 
modules from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Memory 
was a magnetic core type with a basic capacity of 1,024 
twelve-bit words, expandable to 2,048 words. 

The four console modules consisted of a control 
console, an oscilloscope module, a tape module with two 
magnetic-tape drives and a terminal module. The 
oscilloscope module could display a 512 by 512 point 
image. 

A small number of scientific laboratories used the 
LINC computer in dedicated applications. In 1966, DEC 
released a refined version of the LINC computer that 
they named LINC-8 and sold for $43, 000 . During this 
period of time other companies were extending the low 
end of the market by developing small computer systems. 


2/8 Part 1 The Historical Background 
2.4 ... Small Computer Systems 

Other organizations developed small computer 
systems or minicomputers during the 1960's for 
scientific and commercial users (See Chapter 1.6 for 
earlier small computer systems) . This continued to lower 
the cost of computers and extend the concept of personal 
computing. 

DEC delivered the first production version of the 
18-bit PDP-1 minicomputer in early 1961. A minimum 
system cost $85,0000. This was followed by the PDP-4, 
then the 12-bit PDP-5 that cost $27,000 in August 1963. 
The 12-bit PDP-8, which became very successful, was 
announced in late 1964 and the first units delivered in 
April 1965 . DEC marketed the PDP-8 as "the world' s 
lowest-priced, fully programmable computer system." The 
computer used new technology such as small scale hybrid 
integrated circuits to reduce the price of the unit to 
$18, 000 . The PDP-8 had 4K words of core memory, 
expandable to 32K words. Then in August 1966, DEC 
introduced the low cost PDP-8/S system with a console 
teletype for $10,000. In 1967, DEC developed the PDP-8/I 
computer that incorporated TTL technology in place of 
the hybrid integrated circuits. This was followed in the 
summer of 1968 by a similar machine with fewer options 
called the PDP-8/L. The PDP-8/L with 4K of memory and a 
teletype sold for $8,500. 

IBM introduced small systems for technical and 
professional users starting with the Model 1620 in 1961. 
This was a batch-oriented system for FORTRAN users. Then 
IBM released the Model 1130 computing system in 1965. 
The 1130 was a single-user system with an integrated 
disk-based operating system. 

William Hewlett and David Packard founded Hewlett- 
Packard (HP) as a partnership in January 1939 and 
incorporated it as a company in 1947. It was initially a 
manufacturer of electronic test equipment. HP began 
evaluating computers to automate their instrument 
measurement systems in September 1964. This resulted in 
the development of the Model 2116 instrument controller 
in 1966. This was the company's first computer and HP 


Personal Computing in the 1960's 2/9 

sold many units as stand-alone minicomputers. The HP 
2114A minicomputer was released shortly after at a price 
of $9,950. HP also started development of the 9100 
series of electronic desktop calculators in 1966. The 
company released the HP 9100A in 1968, that has been 
described as a "computing calculator." It was a 
predecessor to the programmable calculators released in 
the early 1970' s . 

Other companies competed with DEC, HP and IBM for 
a share of the small system market. Some of these 
companies were: Computer Control Corporation (3C) , 
Control Data Corporation (CDC) , Data Machines, 
Honeywell, Scientific Control Systems (SCS), Scientific 
Data Systems (SDS) and Systems Engineering Laboratories. 
A group of people from DEC established Data General in 
April 1968 and announced their first 16-bit minicomputer 
called the Nova later that year. 

Time sharing, simple high-level programming 
languages and small low cost computer systems were 
significantly increasing the number of users. However 
the interaction between the user and the computer was in 
most cases an awkward process through a teleprinter type 
of console. The 1960's was a decade of significant early 
improvements to the user interface 

2.5... Graphics and the User Interface 

Douglas C. Engelbart developed concepts for 
augmenting the human intellect at the Stanford Research 
Institute (SRI) in Menlo Park, California between 1957 
and 1960. In March 1960, J.C.R. Licklider wrote an 
important paper entitled "Man-Computer Symbiosis" [12, 
pp. 306-318] . The paper contained ideas similar to 
Vannevar Bush's Memex concept, but extended them through 
the use of interactive computer technology. In late 
1962, Engelbart presented his SRI report entitled 
"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework" and 
a proposal to the newly formed Information Processing 
Technigues Office (IPTO) . Licklider, who was the first 
IPTO director, approved the proposal that provided early 


2/10 Part 1 The Historical Background 

government funding for an Augmented Research Center 
(ARC) at SRI in 1963. 

Various graduate students at MIT and staff at 
General Motors Corporation did research on computer 
assisted drafting in the early 1960's. However a turning 
point occurred when Ivan E. Sutherland conducted 
significant research on computer graphics for a doctoral 
thesis in 1962 at MIT. Sutherland created an interactive 
graphics system, that enabled a user to create graphical 
figures on a video display using a light pen. The 
geometrical shapes could be copied, expanded, moved, 
rotated and shrunk. This also resulted in the 
development of the first user interface that 
incorporated a split screen (two-tiled windows), menus 
and the use of icons for such things as constraints to 
limit line lengths. Sutherland published the results of 
this research in an article entitled "Sketchpad: A Man- 
Machine Graphical Communications System" in May 1963. 
This became the basis for computer assisted drafting 
(CAD) and computer assisted engineering (CAE) software 
systems. In the late 1960's various companies such as 
Applicon, Calma and Computervision offered turnkey CAD 
systems . 

The ARC research on facilitating the use of 
computers to extend human knowledge and intellect, 
resulted in the development of significant improvements 
to the user interface. Engelbart concentrated his 
research on an interactive graphics environment as 
compared to the then prevalent teletype communication 
interface. Engelbart evaluated various methods of 
interacting with the screen display. During this 
research he developed the "mouse" in 1964, for which he 
holds the patent. The interactive graphics system also 
used a small five-key keyset that supplemented the 
selection capabilities of the mouse. Another principal 
in the research was William K. English. 

Engelbart's group also developed an on-line system 
with new capabilities called NLS . NLS was an acronym for 
"on-line system." He demonstrated the new system at the 
ACM/IEEE-CS Fall Joint Computer Conference in San 
Francisco, California in December 1968. The NLS system 
incorporated the capabilities for mixing text and 


Personal Computing in the 1960's 2/11 

graphics on the screen display. It also used a split 
screen (two-tiled windows) that led to the development 
of multiple tiled windows in 1969. The group also 
developed an electronic-mail (e-mail) system and 
incorporated it into NLS. 

Between 19 67 and 1969, Alan C. Kay and Edward 
Cheadle built a computer called FLEX at the University 
of Utah. Kay and Cheadle also developed a user interface 
that included multiple tiled windows and sguare icons 
representing data and programs. 

The graphics and user interface research at ARC, 
MIT and the University of Utah led to significant 
developments later at Xerox PARC, Apple Computer and 
Microsoft. SRI transferred activities of the ARC 
research group to Tymshare, Inc., of Cupertino, 
California in 1977. Tymshare renamed the NLS system 
AUGMENT and provided marketing for the product. 
McDonnell Douglas Corporation acguired Tymshare in 1984. 

2.6 ... Software 

COBOL 

The CODASYL group had started development of COBOL 
in 1959. In 1960 the United States government advised 
that they would not accept computer eguipment without a 
COBOL compiler. The development groups defined the 
language and compilers were operating by December of 
1960. 

PL/I 

IBM decided to create an advance common 
programming language that would meet the reguirements of 
both the scientific, commercial and system users in 
1963. The SHARE user's group assisted in the language 
development. IBM initially intended to release the 
language with IBM's new line of System/360 computers. 
The first description of the language was in March 1964. 

The initial name assigned to the new language was 
NPL - New Programming Language. However in 1965 the name 
became PL/I - Programming Language /I. Some ambiguity 
exists in the suffix (I) . The pronunciation is 


2/12 Part 1 The Historical Background 

"Programming Language One," however the suffix is the 
Roman character I and not the Arabic numeral 1. IBM 
released the PL/I compiler in 1966. 

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
subseguently defined a version of the language with a 
reduction in the number of features. ANSI named this 
version, the "G" Subset of PL/I. 

Logo 

Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., (BB&N) in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts started developing Logo in 1966. They then 
pilot-tested the language in the summer of 1967. 
Principals in the development were Seymour Papert, 
Daniel Bobrow, Richard Grant and Wallace Feurzeig who 
gave Logo its name. Charles R. Morgan and Michael Levin 
developed an extended version of Logo during 1967-68. 
The language is designed for use in education by 
children. 

FORTH 

Charles H. Moore developed the FORTH programming 
language around 1968. The language was designed by Moore 
to improve programming productivity. Additional features 
were that it was easy to move to a different machine and 
it reguired a small amount of memory. 

UNIX 

UNIX is an operating system developed by Kenneth 
L. Thompson and Dennis M. Ritchie at AT&T's Bell 
Laboratories. The main feature of the operating system 
was its portability that enabled it to run on almost any 
computer. Bell Laboratories released UNIX in 1969 and 
provided a free license to educational users. This 
resulted in its widespread use at academic institutions. 

ARPANET 

In the 1960's most computers were large mainframes 
with restricted user access. Some had time sharing and 
remote terminals. However remote communication by a 
phone line and data transfer between different computers 
was difficult. 


Personal Computing in the 1960's 2/13 

Paul Baran conducted distributed communications 
research at the RAND Corporation as early as 1962, and 
published details in 1964. Then between 1965 and 1966, 
Donald Davies from the National Physical Laboratory 

(NPL) in the United Kingdom wrote papers describing 
concepts of digital communications using short messages 
or "packets." J.C.R. Licklider, who was the first 
director of the Information Processing Techniques Office 

(IPTO) of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) , 
had also been promoting the concept of an "Intergalactic 
Computer Network." A concept that tried to define the 
benefits and problems of computer networking. 

Around this time period the IPTO was funding 
computer research projects and wanted to improve data 
communications for time sharing and networking. Bob 
Taylor who was the current director of the IPTO and a 
proponent of computer communications, recruited Lawrence 
G. Roberts to lead this networking project. 

Roberts began the experimental computer network 
research in 1966. He then received an appointment to 
manage the IPTO programs for the ARPA in 1967. This led 
to an initial plan for an ARPANET being published in 
October of that year. This network plan would enable 
load sharing, message service, data sharing to link 
university computers and researchers. It would also use 
the "packet" concept, interface message processors 

(IMP's) and leased telecommunication lines. ARPA awarded 
a contract to develop the network to Bolt Beranek and 
Newman (BB&N) in January 1969. Robert Kahn was a 
principal in the overall system design. By December of 
that year they had four nodes of the network installed 
and operating. This packet switching data communication 
system became highly successful in connecting many major 
universities, government organizations and research 
institutions. The ARPANET formed the basis for what 
subsequently became known as the Internet. 

Games 

Student hackers and academic staff developed some 
of the earliest games at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) on the TX-0 and PDP-1 computers. One of 
the games was for a mouse, that would poke its way 


2/14 Part 1 The Historical Background 

through a maze constructed by a light pen to find a blip 
in the shape of cheese. 

Then in 1961 Stephen Russell who was a science 
fiction enthusiast and a student hacker created an 
interactive game called "Space Wars" on the PDP-1 
computer. The game displayed rocket ships that could 
fire missiles in a celestial battlefield. MIT displayed 
the game at the annual Science Open House in May 1962. 
The software was free and received wide distribution. J. 
M. Graetz, Peter Samson and others contributed various 
enhancements to Space Wars that provided additional 
challenges to participants. 

Ralph Baer of Sanders Associates in Nashua, New 
Hampshire received a patent for a ball-and-paddle video 
game using a TV set. Development started in September 
1966. Baer had basic ball-and-paddle games working in 
early 1967 and a hockey game by September. Magnavox 
marketed the game system as Odyssey 100, the world's 
first home video game. 

2. 7 ... Hobby & Amateur Computing 

This aspect of personal computing started from an 
interest by many enthusiasts in the building of their 
own computer. These people were both amateurs and 
professionals with a strong technical interest in 
hardware and software. Prior to the development of large 
scale integrated (LSI) memory chips and the 
microprocessor, it was not easy to build a computer. It 
required a knowledge of vacuum tube or transistor 
circuitry, digital logic, core memory, peripherals and 
other areas. It could also be a costly investment to 
create a complete system. 

In May 1966 Stephen B. Gray founded the Amateur 
Computer Society (ACS) . In August of that year he 
published the first ACS Newsletter devoted to hobby 
computing. The society and newsletter were a significant 
source of information for building a computer in the 
late 1960's and early 1970's. 

The November 1967 issue of the ACS Newsletter 
included a survey requesting details of each member's 


Personal Computing in the 1960's 2/15 

computer. The January 1968 issue reported the following 
results. Clock speeds ranged from 500 kHz to 1 MHz, with 
the average 500 kHz. Instruction sets were small ranging 
from 11 to 34 instructions. The number of registers 
ranged from 2 to 11, with three being the most common. 
Word sizes were from 4 to 32 bits, with 12-bits being 
the average. Memory size ranged from 4 to 8K, all 
magnetic core. Most computers used discrete transistors 
and a few reported the use of integrated circuits. A 
Teletype terminal was the most common input/output 
device. Cost ranged from zero to $1,500, with an average 
of $650. 

The April 1968 issue of Popular Mechanics included 
an article entitled "A Computer in the Basement?" The 
article described the ECHO IV, one of the few home-built 
computers actually completed. ECHO was an acronym for 
Electronic Computing Home Operator. It had a designation 
of IV because it used surplus boards from a Westinghouse 
PRODAC IV computer. James F. Sutherland designed and 
built the computer between 1966 and 1968. ECHO IV was 
seven feet long, six feet high and 18 inches deep. A 
console desk included an electric typewriter keyboard, 
surplus teletype printer, 8-channel paper tape punch and 
an 8-channel paper tape reader. The unit had 120 circuit 
boards using 2N404 transistors and NOR logic elements. 
It had four registers, used 18 instructions with a clock 
speed of 160 kHz. Memory was an 8K surplus core unit. 
The computer is now located at The Computer Museum in 
Boston. 

Many amateurs copied existing designs of small 
computer systems. Some based their designs on 
instruction sets from IBM 1620 or DEC PDP-8 computers. 
Enthusiasts started many computers. However only the 
most determined completed them. 


2/16 Part 1 The Historical Background 

Time sharing, small computer systems and to some 
extent, amateur computing started personal computing in 
the 1960's. Research had also improved the human 
interface to the computer. However the personal computer 
was still complex and expensive to construct. New 
integrated circuit developments that led to the creation 
of the microprocessor significantly reduced this 
complexity.
